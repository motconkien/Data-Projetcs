            "Content": "After completing the course, I was hoping to have a deeper understanding of the subject matter. However, I found that the course only touched on the surface-level concepts and lacked in-depth analysis. The course content was quite basic and did not provide any new insights or knowledge that I was not already aware of. Overall, I was disappointed with the course and felt that it did not meet my expectations. I had expected the course to be more detailed, but unfortunately, I didn't gain much knowledge. The material covered in this course is quite basic."

A huge thanks to our kind Professor, Ms. Summer Scaggs for being a good instructor and delivering the lesson very well during the entire online class.  "

            "Content": "One question in the quiz is confusing.  It says to \"create a worksheet in Excel that shows the number of states for each sales person.  What would you put as the header for column A and column B (in that order)\"  The order of the information provided says \"number of states for each sales person\" which would be option 4, \"No. of States, Salesperson\".  The other interpretation would be option 1, \"Salesperson, No. Of States\".  This question just needs to be more clear so it's not open to interpretation, leading to answering the question incorrectly."

Use it.Event though the content in this course is not to advance but it is always better to have a little understanding of a topic rather than having none.If you are reading this review before attempting it I would like to tell you that this is a pretty basic course you can do it if you don't have any idea of what is excel and how to use it. And it won't take much time. In fact you can clear this course within 1.5 hours if you want to."
