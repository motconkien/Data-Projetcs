Business Analysis & Process Management,By Thomas G,"Dec 15, 2020","""Pause and look at this doc ok welcome back now pause and do it yourself ok you now know how to write a business plan"". The instructor simply read a script verbatim with no punctuation, pauses, or personality. The whole thing was incredibly rushed, and ""rushed"" is not the same thing as ""fast paced"". Absolutely no justification for using the clunky Rhyme virtual desktop, as all you do is open a Google Doc and make a Lucid Chart account. Why would I log into my email and set up another account in your virtual desktop?",1
Business Analysis & Process Management,By Gisela W,"Dec 19, 2020","I like the hands-on platform and the approach of following along with the instructor side by side. However, the instructor speaks way too fast. I lowered the speed to 0.7 and was still struggling to follow. Also, at times the questions/instructions are not 100% clear or confusing so that I wasn't sure what to do and just kept watching. The content is quite superficial. The project does give you some guidance in modeling a simple business process using Lucidchart which I appreciate.",2
Business Analysis & Process Management,By Deleted A,"Feb 11, 2021","Coursera please remove this course!  It's poorly organised , there's background noise on the audio, the instructor asks students to sign into their Google account and then create a Lucidchart account.  All of the learning materials should be within Rhyme.",1
Business Analysis & Process Management,By TUSHAR S,"Feb 1, 2021",This instructor has a very poor style of teaching and doesn't have proper knowledge of the subject. She's reading all the way during the course to explain some technical terms.,1
Business Analysis & Process Management,By Ellvina K,"May 7, 2021","Even at the start I was unable to follow through this project, since the material was not available / no link provided whatsoever to download it. I had high expectation for this guided project but it turned out to be a disappointment. Hope the instructor will give better facilitation so the benefit for this project can be realised.",1

S A A A,"Jun 29, 2022",I think this is a very useful course as it is a guided project for beginners and professionals who run small  businesses or work in the fields of business analysis and business process management.

"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By David J,"Apr 20, 2019","Course focuses more on forcing you to sign up for various IBM cloud tools than learning python.  The final assignment has a 300+ reply thread in the discussion forum because you are graded on the ability to integrate your IBM Watson Notebook with IBM cloud storage, but the instructions have multiple errors, such as not working if you provision your storage in the wrong region.",1
"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Ruben F,"Nov 26, 2018",Still I don't understand the relation of the course' content and the final assignment. ,1
"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Jiayang Z,"Feb 12, 2019","The worst course I took. I couldn't believe the course is provided by IBM. The slide is completely unclear and there are some small mistakes in that. And the final project is aimless, I don't know why you come up with such a project for the beginner. Anyway, I'm so disappointed with IBM and this course. ",1
"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Julian L G,"Jan 4, 2019","It is amazing how bad this is considering that it is marketed as an IBM product. This is not the level of quality people expect when they hear the name IBM! You'd be better off paying 9.99 for a Udemy course than taking this course. It is not in depth at all and does a stunningly poor job at building real understanding and competency. The videos and labs are full of sloppiness and errors... again, not living up to the IBM name. I don't know about y'all, but I'm probably never going to pay money for a coursera course again... not really worth it.",1
"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Robert I,"May 10, 2019","I had a lot of problems with the Peer Assignment, which had nothing to do with Python Programming. The Watson environment has changed a lot compared to the learning materials.",1
"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By William B L,"Mar 15, 2019","Every course has offered something interesting, challenging, and surprising.  I am glad I have spent the time with this class.  I would strongly recommend it to others with an interest in data science.",5
"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Aykut Ö,"Mar 4, 2019","  As in the other parts of the certificate, the tasks are simply too easy. The content in the videos (many typos!!!!) are really valuable but the tasks man... Only the surface of the surface will be discussed, no deeping down into the wild. In this course the libraries numpy and pandas are presented but in the final assignment we actually don't needed the libs... When I read the description of the final assignment, I was excited because I assumed we will need to code EVERYTHING ourselves. So really do the thinking of how to solve the requirements, testing it in a notebook out, reading the docs, discovering new cool stuff... But unfortunately my dream did not come true. The most exciting function was already provided and some of the answers were little bit of copy and paste instead of really recalling newly learned knowledge. Before this review I really wanted to give 4 out of 5 stars but after writing this review I will now give only 2 stars. Actually, 2 stars are in my opinion unfair, since the creators have put a lot of time and love in the course content. Unfortunately, so much potential is thrown away  ",2
"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Asim I,"May 21, 2019", (5 stars):  Course was great!!  ,1
"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Declan H M G,"May 22, 2019","The course content is good. However, the instructions for the final peer graded assignment are unclear. It appears to me that we were graded on our ability to interact with IBM cloud and Watson service not so much python skills also. Although I completed, I would not recommend to other until changes are made. It seems I'm not the only one that is unhappy or who had difficulties, just look at the week 5 discussion forum!",1
"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Jennifer P,"Dec 27, 2018","This class was supposed to be for beginners and most of the information in the videos was easy to digest, however, the final project had elements and questions that were never covered. Also, there were many, many spelling and context errors in the videos and quizzes. This lead to a tremendous amount of confusion and I am not happy with this course or my grade. Please consider reviewing the lessons and final project to cater this course more to beginners.",1
"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Steve O,"Oct 31, 2018","The IBM cloud ""service"" leaves much to be desired. Multiple times I've experienced outages while I was in the middle of lab assignments. It's a paid course where they give you ""free"" credits to do the course work in their cloud ""service."" But the credits are inadequate for the labs and they constantly ask for your credit card to buy more ""service."" While the class is okay I wouldn't recommend it to anyone because of the poor IBM cloud support.",1
"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Het P,"Feb 18, 2019","Time waster, doesn't go in depth, the total video content is of less then 2 hours. The quizzes and assignments are too easy.",1
"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Jason U,"Nov 15, 2018",The final project at week 5 needs to be completely revamped.  Poor learning experience...absolutely ridiculous and is creating tremendous frustration amongst all students.,1

"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Farzaneh G,"Jan 8, 2019","It was basic Python. You need this to be able to use Python for data science, however the name of the course could have been Python 101.",4
"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Semant J P,"May 6, 2019","Overall, the course lectures are highly condensed and fly by very quickly. I'm familiar with Python but I still had to go back and review them a few times. Would prefer the video materials to be reviewed more slowly and deliberately.",3
"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Vigneshwaran P,"Mar 2, 2019","Need detailed explanation for the topics, course need to be rephrased accordingly.",1
"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Thabo M,"Nov 19, 2019","it becomes easier wand clearer when one gets to complete the assignments as to how to utilize what has been learned. Practical work is a great way to learn, which was a fundamental part of the course.",5
"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Sujai C,"Apr 19, 2019",The programming assignment had errors and it took a long time to figure out  (e.g. wrong endpoint was specified).  I ended up having to waste a lot of time on this.,2
"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By ruhul a,"Mar 27, 2020","Python is just what is in trend and not because of its usability, but it is just anybody can use with wide use case in each and every domain. A good start for someone looking for a start with Python   ",5
"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Fredrik R,"Mar 18, 2019",Seems to teach fundamentals but the final graded assignment had very little to do with what was taught,2
"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Arjan Z,"May 23, 2019","the final assignment was extremely poorly set-up. Instructions were full of gaps, omissions, spelling mistakes. Looked like it was written by a deep-expert who assumed a lot of knowledge that you do not have at this entry level and that was nowhere made explicit. I spend many hours on a number of evenings figuring what was meant. If this lead to constructive learning, I'd be OK with it. But now it was just a long egg-hunt to figure out how I was to post something using idiosyncratic IBM infrastructure which taught me little about Python. Was this course even test driven?",1
"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Simon O,"Apr 20, 2019",Final test needs to be actually tested by instructors. Has a few bugs in it. You would learn more about python reading a book. ,1
"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Pranay C,"May 27, 2019","Very good course for people who do not know Python. It just starts with the basic and focuses on data structures which is essential for Data Science. Does not teach you any unessential Python syntax which will not be useful in this specialization course. If you know any programming language, you will get it (because Python is easier and simpler than the language you know :)",5

Introduction to Microsoft Excel,By AYSHA S,"Feb 9, 2024","After completing the course, I was hoping to have a deeper understanding of the subject matter. However, I found that the course only touched on the surface-level concepts and lacked in-depth analysis. The course content was quite basic and did not provide any new insights or knowledge that I was not already aware of. Overall, I was disappointed with the course and felt that it did not meet my expectations. I had expected the course to be more detailed, but unfortunately, I didn't gain much knowledge. The material covered in this course is quite basic.",1
Introduction to Microsoft Excel,By Ayesha N,"Feb 17, 2024","Complete waste of time for someone who knows the VERY BASICS of excel. if you have never even heard of excel before then this is for you, but even then there would be better ways to learn the basics",1

A huge thanks to our kind Professor, Ms. Summer Scaggs for being a good instructor and delivering the lesson very well during the entire online class.  ",5
Introduction to Microsoft Excel,By Annalisa G,"Apr 5, 2022","One question in the quiz is confusing.  It says to ""create a worksheet in Excel that shows the number of states for each sales person.  What would you put as the header for column A and column B (in that order)""  The order of the information provided says ""number of states for each sales person"" which would be option 4, ""No. of States, Salesperson"".  The other interpretation would be option 1, ""Salesperson, No. Of States"".  This question just needs to be more clear so it's not open to interpretation, leading to answering the question incorrectly.",4

Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Basil K,"May 18, 2022","There is so much information missing in the labs in this course esp starting from Week 3. The videos it seems like were put together in a hurry with crucial information missing and labs are even worse than the videos. They are expecting one to find, set, unset files in extremely long scripts without providing any information on how it is done. Furthermore, there is little to no information given on why certain commands are called what they are called making this course not at all intuitive.

I feel like I learned almost nothing!",1
Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Mateusz K,"Jan 24, 2024","Everything that follows, is just my own personal opinion, if not stated otherwise. It is based on my observations and interactions with teaching staff in the course discussion forums (for the last few months).
This is a very poorly executed course.
As of today (23 Jan 2024) this course for me still does not meet the criteria of a ""good resource for learning"" the basics of Linux CLI and shell scripting (despite few minor improvements already applied).
Some of the topics are hastily skimmed through in the videos, and almost no mechanism presented in the course is thoroughly explained.
Many of the ""basic concepts"" for Bash (and other modern shells) like e.g. function definitions, proper error handling, etc., are not even included in the course.
The importance of using correct quotations for variable/parameter expansions is also never mentioned nor explained, although it should be considered essential ""best practice"".
Peer-graded Final Assignment instructions/""guide"" contains some errors and not fully tested solutions, advertised as ""working correctly"".
The similar can be said about grading rubrics for the final assignment - which additionally are not focused on the actual results of the code execution, but instead they're focused on the code ""looks"", as in its visual resemblance (being as close to ""identical"" as possible) to what the course's staff have written in the grading rubrics.
In some cases, if the teaching staff finds a question in a discussion forum a bit more ""inconvenient"" for them to answer (or they're not fully capable of providing the correct answer to it in a timely manner?), then they would rather:
a) ignore the question completely (the least they can do is to not get involved at all) or reply with something similar to: ""we'll investigate the issue and get back to you"" (the latter ""get back to you"" almost never happens for a ""more complicated"" question);
b) reply with some irrelevant, impractical, incorrect, or otherwise unuseful information;
c) politely ask, to not bring the subject up ever again, as it may ""overwhelm the learners"";
d) delete the post (most often containing a valid, correct answer to the question) from discussion forums (I see censorship as ""means of hiding incompetence""?)
e) repeat other learner's correct answer (sometimes only slightly modifying it);
f) use and completely rely on AI LLM (e.g. ChatGPT, Bard, or other) and answers provided by it (which are mostly ridiculous), without even basic output verification; 
g) and also (occasionally) delete any relevant corrections (made by more knowledgeable learners) to previous staff's posts/replies;
than admit to any mistakes in the course contents, admit to lack of expertise in the subject matter, and address the questions properly - e.g. by allowing open discussion on potential improvements to the course materials, and implementing all said improvements as soon as possible (after reviewing).
These practices have been reported, and as I was assured by the Coursera Support Team, this kind of inappropriate teaching staff's behaviors will be escalated further, so I'm awaiting next developments of the situation.
But I still think this kind of inappropriate behaviors are a clear example, of what gives (or rather should give) the Skill-Up Technologies Pvt. Ltd. / SkillUp Online (employers for the most of ""teaching staff"") a bad reputation.
This also might give Coursera courses and IBM Skills Network a really bad publicity in a long-run.
Teaching and following ""best practices"", and answering doubts with relevant, thorough, technical knowledge in the discussion forums of this course... is something you unlikely/rarely find coming from the teaching staff.
Generally, teaching staff don't seem to be fit for the job of thoroughly explaining the course materials and teaching the proper ""understanding"" of your mistakes (as hard as they try to be seen ""cooperative""),
but as I see it, they're better suited for
a) only requesting you to ""copy and paste"" their code samples, that they believe should work best as a ""correct solution"" in their opinions (side note, again, ""my opinion"" - their code doesn't work all that great, and is not written with all the ""best practices"" in mind) and 
b) deleting ""inconvenient"" posts from the discussion forums whenever they please.
To sum it up: in its current form, and with its current teaching staff replying in the discussion forums, I'd definitely not recommend this course to anyone, especially beginners. And I'd discourage seeking any ""great"" learning experience from Skill-Up Technologies Pvt. Ltd. / SkillUp Online - thus I'd strongly suggest searching for some other, better resources on the subjects regarding basics of working with Linux CLI and shell scripting.

Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Volkert d V,"Jan 19, 2024","I have a few qualms on this still good, dense course: (1) - there is a lot of jargon that is taken for granted. For someone new to programming - you can easily get lost - especially when certain programs are only mentioned once and then taken to be known (e.g. Kubernetes, RedHat etc.) A cheat sheet would be very welcome. (2) the videos, while clear, are very dense, and the voice is very mono-tone which became quite a turn-down. To make sure students capture it it would be helpful to have more cross-checking questions during the lecture. (3) the final peer reviewed exercise is tricky and the peer review system doesn't work that great. with all the talk on automated checking in IBMs DevOps course I would think an automated check would be more effective - and could actually point out to you what you did wrong. for example - I had trouble figuring out a certain line of code and I actually asked chatGPT - turns out I had one space too much. in another case I came up with a slightly different code which did the same job.

Introductory Human Physiology,By Maxine P M,"Jun 28, 2020","The primary reason for enrolling in the course was to enhance my knowledge base of human physiology. Although it has been many decades since I've taken anatomy and physiology as well as pathophysiology, I have taught it twice at the secondary level.  Upon reviewing the description of the course, it indicated that it was introductory, but knowledge of biology/science would be helpful, I thought it might be a great refresher course.  I beg to differ! This course WAS NOT introductory.  Let me give you the positives first: pdf's and readings were extremely helpful.  The negatives, the instructors were not impressive. One instructor talked absolutely too fast and much too often wouldn't complete the sentences OR she would repeat words or phrases that didn't make sense. I found it difficult to grasp the lecture when this instructor couldn't get through a sentence without stumbling over her thoughts, mumbling, trailing off and not finishing her sentence, etc. More often than not, the information provided in the lecture was inconsistent with the notes/pdf's. One other thing, she constantly smacked her mouth which was nerve-wrecking!  During the lectures, she would write on the powerpoints, which was either sloppy or not legible. After the fifth week, I honestly wanted to withdraw from the course, but decided to finish it out solely because it was half way completed and the time that had already been invested.  Many viewers gave the course 5 stars, I could not.  Although I completed the course with a 93.4% grade, the level of information was extensive, to some degree over the top.  The course needs to be restructured so that it stays within the context of an introductory course.  In my opinion, this course is more suitable for a first-second year medical student.  BTW, this is the sixth course that I have completed through Coursera, including a specialization.  Good luck!",2
Introductory Human Physiology,By Jade D,"Jan 5, 2021","Best course I've ever taken!  Detailed and thorough explanations of the systems of the body.  Fascinating, enlightening, and enjoyable.  Highly recommend for anyone interested in how the body functions.",5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Sylvia Q,"Jan 18, 2020","Great class - very dense, like drinking from a fire hose, but wow I learned a lot! I took this just because I wanted to learn more about how the body magically does what it does, every day, without me thinking about it. I had no prior experience in physiology or anatomy, so this required me to do a LOT of note-taking and a little bit of Googling on the side for further understanding. If a week's videos totaled 2 hours, I spent about 4-5 getting through them and taking notes. I should add that I did not use the forums regularly, but I saw that many students had, and that their questions were answered fairly promptly, often by Emma Jakoi herself. The end-of-unit quizzes always included questions which forced you to apply your new learning to cases, and these could be challenging! Thanks to Duke for making this great class available online for free.",5

Introductory Human Physiology,By Joshua S,"Dec 9, 2019"," It is so hard to learn from a professor who can't get through 2  sentences without stumbling over her thoughts, mumbling, trailing off  and not finishing her sentence, etc. Perhaps if she spent less time  pretending to be John Madden with her little board, she could focus on  being an effective orator. Perhaps the second professor would have been better, but after 2 hours of listening to Dr. Jakoi, I now have to contact Coursera to see if I can get a refund or switch courses.",1
Introductory Human Physiology,By Anastasiia N,"Oct 24, 2015","The effect of this course in understanding the body physiology and understanding the terminology of other courses can be compared to learning to read. Now I can take other, more specialized courses without having to Google every other word and actually understand the processes they're talking about instead of simply memorizing them. ",5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Dustin J,"Aug 23, 2020","I'm a college freshman (majoring in nursing) and I took this course due to the pandemic. I found this course challenging since it focuses more on the physiology of the human body in more detail than a regular my anatomy and physiology class back in high school. This course isn't really an ""introductory"" course, you may need some background on science courses like chemistry, biology, anatomy, and physiology (So keep that in mind if you want to enroll). I have a limited background in science these courses (Biology, chemistry, etc) and finished this course, and yes it is possible to finish this course without knowing all about science stuff, it just took a little more effort to quickly learn science terms and stuff. With all of that, the course was great and for a nursing major like me really helped me developed surface-level knowledge about the function of the human body. Lectures are good, a little fast for me but they provide great PDF that I can refer to. Practice quizzes did help me a lot, but I hope that they provide feedback or explanation on why I got it wrong instead of just showing ""correct"" or ""incorrect"". It's worth my time learning physiology and I highly recommend it! Big thanks to the instructors and staff, especially Coursera for making this course free to the public!",5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Karen J,"May 10, 2020","Definitely, this is not an introductory course. Actually, you need some prior background in physiology, biology, chemistry, anatomy before taking it. It is also very challenging!  ",5

Introductory Human Physiology,By Lucie P,"Jul 26, 2016","This course seems to require a high level of foundation knowledge that I don't have.

It helps me to gain better knowledge and information to what happens to our body in response to all those external influences of stress, intake of food and liquid.  All the lectures are very professionally conducted with clear notes in the resources.  Many times, video lectures provided very good external cases beyond the texts.  I must also respect that both of you continue with the lectures despite hearing coughing many times throughout.  Great professionalism demonstrated, even in such coursera.co course.",5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Christine A,"Apr 20, 2020","This course is excellent, if physiology is something you need for your career/personal interest. Mimi Jakoi and  Jennifer Carbrey are magnificent in their field, and they both provide their tremendous insight to a high-functioning foundation level for the subject. However, if you are someone like me, a middle school science teacher who was only looking to find a novice level of physiology, you are going to get above and beyond what you imagined. I would definitely recommend this course to those who are highly invested in the subject, as it provides a great breadth of detail to 10 human systems. ",5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Parvathy s n,"May 28, 2022",it was a fun ride to be a part of this journey of learning  HUMAN PHYSIOLOGY .....it was very much helpful for understanding the basic concepts of our body how our body functions internally as well their hormonal capabilities. i feel really confident now because the lecture was easy to understand i thoroughly enjoyed. thank you. ,5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Pei-Hsuan L,"Jun 12, 2020","I don't speak for everyone, but this course was relatively difficult for an introductory course. It required an adequate amount of base/foundation on the subject in order for one to understand what the lesson is talking about. ",3

Thank you for all for all of the hard work required to create such a comprehensive course,5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Calista L,"Oct 8, 2020","Great things first: It’s a great course, with quite an
amount of information each video each module. For each week’s two to three
video hours, I spent 5 to 6 hours researching through googling or textbook
reading, and an intense note-taking all along. I highly recommend anyone who
wants a ‘warm-up’ in college physiology to do this course. This is perhaps a
first college level physiology, but it’s no way ‘introductory’. For a student with
mostly humanities background like me, it’s going to be a challenging course.
But it is really worth doing.",5

First Step Korean,By Mailine Y,"Oct 25, 2019","This class was very hard to follow. Pronunciation is key to any language. This course does not help you become even close to basic proficiency because there is no pronunciation key available. The worksheets are so hard to follow because it's all in Hangul with no pronunciation key or english pronunciation available. For a beginner course, this should have been standard- we don't know how to read Hangul and it shouldn't be expected during a beginners course. This course has a lot of room for improvement and would be great once they are implemented to become more user friendly. Also, rather than just using Hangul and English words in the videos, there should be pronunciation underneath the Hangul to make sure students are really getting the words correct instead of them trying to figure out word it is and referring to worksheets all the time. I did not have a good time learning the language because it was so frustrating trying to figure out what she was saying exactly- thus making the quizzes even more difficult!!",2
First Step Korean,By Lynne,"Dec 16, 2016",It was very well organised and presented. There was good opportunity for repetition in the videos and good opportunity to study the main written expressions and grammar in the PDF files. Excellent!,5

I did still learn a great deal of vocabulary.",3

I do think that you have to come into this course with an understanding of the Korean alphabet and basic knowledge of how to compose and read letters. Once you have that down, this course definitely helps you begin to move forward in becoming fluent with verbal and written comprehension. You definitely have to practice and repeat your practice consistently to retain your new knowledge. I love this course. Thank you!",5

First Step Korean,By Kathy C,"Feb 15, 2017","This was a good course, but much more ambitious than the description or name suggests.  I had to watch the videos at 75% speed in order to figure out what was actually said, as I have never heard any Korean before.  I used the quizlet flashcards and some youtube videos in order to learn the material, as the ""lecture notes"" were not always very helpful.  So in all, a good course if you can access some supplementary activities.  In fact, adding the quizlet flashcards to the lesson either before the lecture or before the quiz would be helpful for future students.  I plan to take the class again in order to master the material.",3

Financial Markets,By Deleted A,"Apr 23, 2019","This course is virtually worthless. I couldn't follow the lectures, and I have a PhD and have been a tenured professor for almost two decades. The online course is based on snippets taken from face-to-face lectures and breakout sessions, and the result is utter incoherence. The instructor frequently refers to concepts that have not yet been encountered in the online version of the course; makes extensive use of mathematical notations and formulas whose variables are never properly explained; and generally does a poor job of explaining the material. This online version of the Yale course was obviously slapped together with very little thought and production value; it's one of those unsuccessful attempts to bring in revenue on the cheap, creating an online version out of existing face-to-face material, rather than building a real online course from scratch. This was wasted money and time. This attempt to capitalize on the Yale brand is pathetic.    ",1

The strongest point of this course is the simplicity with which it conveys the importance and relevance of finance in today's world. The instructor and his team have taken great care to introduce topics in a manner simple enough for anyone to understand. While the course content may not go very in-depth into how a particular stock market works, or how particular stocks move, it provides great insight into why the stock market is necessary and relevant in our current society and how human behavior and its expression through policy and law can result in both financial progress and also crisis.

I have gained the basic knowledge of financial markets and their applications in reality. Absolutely right, finance is not just about making money that I thought before joining in this course, and as a popular opinion as well, it is more than that, it has much more meaningful. This course has brought to me the necessary skills to make more rational decisions in my life, in my future career, I think. It’s also helped me to realize how I should work in this sector to serve the right purposes, to make the people living around me to be better. And it’s true that educational finance is very important to everyone. Professor Robert Shiller is an amazing teacher, many thanks to Professor Robert Shiller and Yale’s Financial Markets Course team.

Financial Markets,By Anthony S,"Jan 10, 2019","Some parts of the course were informative.  Some were disappointing.  Replaying it in my mind now that I'm done, I feel that the course dwelt on the flaws of financial markets, rather than being an explanation of their workings.  It was an indictment of markets more than I would have expected, instead of being instructive toward them.  There was a section toward the end on ""critics of finance"".  Far less effort was made in defense of modern finance (a wonderful field).",3

"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Aykut Ö,"Mar 4, 2019","  As in the other parts of the certificate, the tasks are simply too easy. The content in the videos (many typos!!!!) are really valuable but the tasks man... Only the surface of the surface will be discussed, no deeping down into the wild. In this course the libraries numpy and pandas are presented but in the final assignment we actually don't needed the libs... When I read the description of the final assignment, I was excited because I assumed we will need to code EVERYTHING ourselves. So really do the thinking of how to solve the requirements, testing it in a notebook out, reading the docs, discovering new cool stuff... But unfortunately my dream did not come true. The most exciting function was already provided and some of the answers were little bit of copy and paste instead of really recalling newly learned knowledge. Before this review I really wanted to give 4 out of 5 stars but after writing this review I will now give only 2 stars. Actually, 2 stars are in my opinion unfair, since the creators have put a lot of time and love in the course content. Unfortunately, so much potential is thrown away  ",2

"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Declan H M G,"May 22, 2019","The course content is good. However, the instructions for the final peer graded assignment are unclear.

"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Jennifer P,"Dec 27, 2018","This class was supposed to be for beginners and most of the information in the videos was easy to digest, however, the final project had elements and questions that were never covered.

"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Steve O,"Oct 31, 2018","The IBM cloud ""service"" leaves much to be desired. Multiple times I've experienced outages while I was in the middle of lab assignments. It's a paid course where they give you ""free"" credits to do the course work in their cloud ""service."" But the credits are inadequate for the labs and they constantly ask for your credit card to buy more ""service.""

I spend many hours on a number of evenings figuring what was meant. If this lead to constructive learning, I'd be OK with it. But now it was just a long egg-hunt to figure out how I was to post something using idiosyncratic IBM infrastructure which taught me little about Python. Was this course even test driven?",1

Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Basil K,"May 18, 2022","There is so much information missing in the labs in this course esp starting from Week 3. The videos it seems like were put together in a hurry with crucial information missing and labs are even worse than the videos. They are expecting one to find, set, unset files in extremely long scripts without providing any information on how it is done. Furthermore, there is little to no information given on why certain commands are called what they are called making this course not at all intuitive. I wish someone else has reviewed this course before putting it online. Such a wasted opportunity to educate people. ",1

I feel like I learned almost nothing!",1
Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Mateusz K,"Jan 24, 2024","Everything that follows, is just my own personal opinion, if not stated otherwise. It is based on my observations and interactions with teaching staff in the course discussion forums (for the last few months).
This is a very poorly executed course.
As of today (23 Jan 2024) this course for me still does not meet the criteria of a ""good resource for learning"" the basics of Linux CLI and shell scripting (despite few minor improvements already applied).
Some of the topics are hastily skimmed through in the videos, and almost no mechanism presented in the course is thoroughly explained.
Many of the ""basic concepts"" for Bash (and other modern shells) like e.g. function definitions, proper error handling, etc., are not even included in the course.
The importance of using correct quotations for variable/parameter expansions is also never mentioned nor explained, although it should be considered essential ""best practice"".
Peer-graded Final Assignment instructions/""guide"" contains some errors and not fully tested solutions, advertised as ""working correctly"".
The similar can be said about grading rubrics for the final assignment - which additionally are not focused on the actual results of the code execution, but instead they're focused on the code ""looks"", as in its visual resemblance (being as close to ""identical"" as possible) to what the course's staff have written in the grading rubrics.
In some cases, if the teaching staff finds a question in a discussion forum a bit more ""inconvenient"" for them to answer (or they're not fully capable of providing the correct answer to it in a timely manner?), then they would rather:
a) ignore the question completely (the least they can do is to not get involved at all) or reply with something similar to: ""we'll investigate the issue and get back to you"" (the latter ""get back to you"" almost never happens for a ""more complicated"" question);
b) reply with some irrelevant, impractical, incorrect, or otherwise unuseful information;
c) politely ask, to not bring the subject up ever again, as it may ""overwhelm the learners"";
d) delete the post (most often containing a valid, correct answer to the question) from discussion forums (I see censorship as ""means of hiding incompetence""?)
e) repeat other learner's correct answer (sometimes only slightly modifying it);
f) use and completely rely on AI LLM (e.g. ChatGPT, Bard, or other) and answers provided by it (which are mostly ridiculous), without even basic output verification; 
g) and also (occasionally) delete any relevant corrections (made by more knowledgeable learners) to previous staff's posts/replies;
than admit to any mistakes in the course contents, admit to lack of expertise in the subject matter, and address the questions properly - e.g. by allowing open discussion on potential improvements to the course materials, and implementing all said improvements as soon as possible (after reviewing).
These practices have been reported, and as I was assured by the Coursera Support Team, this kind of inappropriate teaching staff's behaviors will be escalated further, so I'm awaiting next developments of the situation.
But I still think this kind of inappropriate behaviors are a clear example, of what gives (or rather should give) the Skill-Up Technologies Pvt. Ltd. / SkillUp Online (employers for the most of ""teaching staff"") a bad reputation.
This also might give Coursera courses and IBM Skills Network a really bad publicity in a long-run.
Teaching and following ""best practices"", and answering doubts with relevant, thorough, technical knowledge in the discussion forums of this course... is something you unlikely/rarely find coming from the teaching staff.
Generally, teaching staff don't seem to be fit for the job of thoroughly explaining the course materials and teaching the proper ""understanding"" of your mistakes (as hard as they try to be seen ""cooperative""),
but as I see it, they're better suited for
a) only requesting you to ""copy and paste"" their code samples, that they believe should work best as a ""correct solution"" in their opinions (side note, again, ""my opinion"" - their code doesn't work all that great, and is not written with all the ""best practices"" in mind) and 
b) deleting ""inconvenient"" posts from the discussion forums whenever they please.
To sum it up: in its current form, and with its current teaching staff replying in the discussion forums, I'd definitely not recommend this course to anyone, especially beginners. And I'd discourage seeking any ""great"" learning experience from Skill-Up Technologies Pvt. Ltd. / SkillUp Online - thus I'd strongly suggest searching for some other, better resources on the subjects regarding basics of working with Linux CLI and shell scripting.

Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Volkert d V,"Jan 19, 2024","I have a few qualms on this still good, dense course: (1) - there is a lot of jargon that is taken for granted. For someone new to programming - you can easily get lost - especially when certain programs are only mentioned once and then taken to be known (e.g. Kubernetes, RedHat etc.) A cheat sheet would be very welcome. (2) the videos, while clear, are very dense, and the voice is very mono-tone which became quite a turn-down. To make sure students capture it it would be helpful to have more cross-checking questions during the lecture. (3) the final peer reviewed exercise is tricky and the peer review system doesn't work that great. with all the talk on automated checking in IBMs DevOps course I would think an automated check would be more effective - and could actually point out to you what you did wrong. for example - I had trouble figuring out a certain line of code and I actually asked chatGPT - turns out I had one space too much. in another case I came up with a slightly different code which did the same job.

Introductory Human Physiology,By Maxine P M,"Jun 28, 2020","The primary reason for enrolling in the course was to enhance my knowledge base of human physiology. Although it has been many decades since I've taken anatomy and physiology as well as pathophysiology, I have taught it twice at the secondary level.  Upon reviewing the description of the course, it indicated that it was introductory, but knowledge of biology/science would be helpful, I thought it might be a great refresher course.  I beg to differ! This course WAS NOT introductory.  Let me give you the positives first: pdf's and readings were extremely helpful.  The negatives, the instructors were not impressive. One instructor talked absolutely too fast and much too often wouldn't complete the sentences OR she would repeat words or phrases that didn't make sense. I found it difficult to grasp the lecture when this instructor couldn't get through a sentence without stumbling over her thoughts, mumbling, trailing off and not finishing her sentence, etc. More often than not, the information provided in the lecture was inconsistent with the notes/pdf's. One other thing, she constantly smacked her mouth which was nerve-wrecking!  During the lectures, she would write on the powerpoints, which was either sloppy or not legible. After the fifth week, I honestly wanted to withdraw from the course, but decided to finish it out solely because it was half way completed and the time that had already been invested.  Many viewers gave the course 5 stars, I could not.  Although I completed the course with a 93.4% grade, the level of information was extensive, to some degree over the top.  The course needs to be restructured so that it stays within the context of an introductory course.  In my opinion, this course is more suitable for a first-second year medical student.  BTW, this is the sixth course that I have completed through Coursera, including a specialization.  Good luck!",2

I took this just because I wanted to learn more about how the body magically does what it does, every day, without me thinking about it. I had no prior experience in physiology or anatomy, so this required me to do a LOT of note-taking and a little bit of Googling on the side for further understanding. If a week's videos totaled 2 hours, I spent about 4-5 getting through them and taking notes. I should add that I did not use the forums regularly, but I saw that many students had, and that their questions were answered fairly promptly, often by Emma Jakoi herself. The end-of-unit quizzes always included questions which forced you to apply your new learning to cases, and these could be challenging! Thanks to Duke for making this great class available online for free.",5

Introductory Human Physiology,By Joshua S,"Dec 9, 2019"," It is so hard to learn from a professor who can't get through 2  sentences without stumbling over her thoughts, mumbling, trailing off  and not finishing her sentence, etc. Perhaps if she spent less time  pretending to be John Madden with her little board, she could focus on  being an effective orator. Perhaps the second professor would have been better, but after 2 hours of listening to Dr. Jakoi, I now have to contact Coursera to see if I can get a refund or switch courses.",1

Introductory Human Physiology,By Dustin J,"Aug 23, 2020","I'm a college freshman (majoring in nursing) and I took this course due to the pandemic. I found this course challenging since it focuses more on the physiology of the human body in more detail than a regular my anatomy and physiology class back in high school. This course isn't really an ""introductory"" course, you may need some background on science courses like chemistry, biology, anatomy, and physiology (So keep that in mind if you want to enroll). I have a limited background in science these courses (Biology, chemistry, etc) and finished this course, and yes it is possible to finish this course without knowing all about science stuff, it just took a little more effort to quickly learn science terms and stuff. With all of that, the course was great and for a nursing major like me really helped me developed surface-level knowledge about the function of the human body. Lectures are good, a little fast for me but they provide great PDF that I can refer to. Practice quizzes did help me a lot, but I hope that they provide feedback or explanation on why I got it wrong instead of just showing ""correct"" or ""incorrect"". It's worth my time learning physiology and I highly recommend it! Big thanks to the instructors and staff, especially Coursera for making this course free to the public!",5

However, if you are someone like me, a middle school science teacher who was only looking to find a novice level of physiology, you are going to get above and beyond what you imagined.

Introductory Human Physiology,By Andreas A,"Jan 19, 2018","Great course, good as a supplementary to taking the university course.",5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Bryony R,"Feb 10, 2019",I am about to start a degree in nursing and this was an excellent introduction.  The pace was quite fast and the content is quite technical but through rereading the materials and watching some supplementary explanations (such as Khan academy) it all made sense. Thank you for all for all of the hard work required to create such a comprehensive course,5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Calista L,"Oct 8, 2020","Great things first: It’s a great course, with quite an
amount of information each video each module. For each week’s two to three
video hours, I spent 5 to 6 hours researching through googling or textbook
reading, and an intense note-taking all along. I highly recommend anyone who
wants a ‘warm-up’ in college physiology to do this course. This is perhaps a
first college level physiology, but it’s no way ‘introductory’. For a student with
mostly humanities background like me, it’s going to be a challenging course.
But it is really worth doing.",5

First Step Korean,By Mailine Y,"Oct 25, 2019","This class was very hard to follow. Pronunciation is key to any language. This course does not help you become even close to basic proficiency because there is no pronunciation key available. The worksheets are so hard to follow because it's all in Hangul with no pronunciation key or english pronunciation available. For a beginner course, this should have been standard- we don't know how to read Hangul and it shouldn't be expected during a beginners course. This course has a lot of room for improvement and would be great once they are implemented to become more user friendly. Also, rather than just using Hangul and English words in the videos, there should be pronunciation underneath the Hangul to make sure students are really getting the words correct instead of them trying to figure out word it is and referring to worksheets all the time. I did not have a good time learning the language because it was so frustrating trying to figure out what she was saying exactly- thus making the quizzes even more difficult!!",2
First Step Korean,By Lynne,"Dec 16, 2016",It was very well organised and presented. There was good opportunity for repetition in the videos and good opportunity to study the main written expressions and grammar in the PDF files. Excellent!,5

First Step Korean,By LeapingFrog E,"Nov 17, 2016","Although the instructor was good at presenting the information, I felt that the reference sheets should of had the phonetic pronunciations next to the Korean writing.

I did still learn a great deal of vocabulary.",3

First Step Korean,By jenn (,"Nov 30, 2018","This is the first online course where I can begin to understand how to put sentence structure together and begin to understand honorifics. I do think that you have to come into this course with an understanding of the Korean alphabet and basic knowledge of how to compose and read letters. Once you have that down, this course definitely helps you begin to move forward in becoming fluent with verbal and written comprehension. You definitely have to practice and repeat your practice consistently to retain your new knowledge. I love this course. Thank you!",5
First Step Korean,By Büşra G,"Oct 17, 2017",I wish there was korean subtitles instead of [FOREIGN] .,3
First Step Korean,By Kathy C,"Feb 15, 2017","This was a good course, but much more ambitious than the description or name suggests.  I had to watch the videos at 75% speed in order to figure out what was actually said, as I have never heard any Korean before.  I used the quizlet flashcards and some youtube videos in order to learn the material, as the ""lecture notes"" were not always very helpful.  So in all, a good course if you can access some supplementary activities.  In fact, adding the quizlet flashcards to the lesson either before the lecture or before the quiz would be helpful for future students.  I plan to take the class again in order to master the material.",3
First Step Korean,By KANCHAPORN C,"Apr 17, 2020",Thank for the free course and certificate. I'm from Thailand. I would like to improve my self  about language in quarantine period. Your web is the best way for study at home. It's good for every one.,5

Financial Markets,By Deleted A,"Apr 23, 2019","This course is virtually worthless. I couldn't follow the lectures, and I have a PhD and have been a tenured professor for almost two decades. The online course is based on snippets taken from face-to-face lectures and breakout sessions, and the result is utter incoherence. The instructor frequently refers to concepts that have not yet been encountered in the online version of the course; makes extensive use of mathematical notations and formulas whose variables are never properly explained; and generally does a poor job of explaining the material. This online version of the Yale course was obviously slapped together with very little thought and production value; it's one of those unsuccessful attempts to bring in revenue on the cheap, creating an online version out of existing face-to-face material, rather than building a real online course from scratch. This was wasted money and time. This attempt to capitalize on the Yale brand is pathetic.    ",1
Financial Markets,By Sanam P,"Oct 23, 2017","This course was horrible! The Content was very disoriented and unclear. Videos were distorted, and jumping from one topic to another. There was no sense of continuity. One can not say this was a course from Yale...",1

Financial Markets,By Tiyash B,"May 3, 2018","A great introductory level course which is recommended for anyone with a remote interest in finance irrespective of whether they have a background in finance or economics. The strongest point of this course is the simplicity with which it conveys the importance and relevance of finance in today's world. The instructor and his team have taken great care to introduce topics in a manner simple enough for anyone to understand. While the course content may not go very in-depth into how a particular stock market works, or how particular stocks move, it provides great insight into why the stock market is necessary and relevant in our current society and how human behavior and its expression through policy and law can result in both financial progress and also crisis.

Financial Markets,By Doan T L ,"May 26, 2019","It’s a good online course in Finance that I have never learned before. I have gained the basic knowledge of financial markets and their applications in reality. Absolutely right, finance is not just about making money that I thought before joining in this course, and as a popular opinion as well, it is more than that, it has much more meaningful. This course has brought to me the necessary skills to make more rational decisions in my life, in my future career, I think. It’s also helped me to realize how I should work in this sector to serve the right purposes, to make the people living around me to be better. And it’s true that educational finance is very important to everyone. Professor Robert Shiller is an amazing teacher, many thanks to Professor Robert Shiller and Yale’s Financial Markets Course team. I highly recommend taking this course! ",5
Financial Markets,By Stefano E,"Mar 17, 2019","Probably the best financial market course on coursera. Intense and very rich in content. Too much,  though.

With all due respect to the lecturer, he was not very engaging and did not really provide emphasis on key concepts to make it stick. When explaining the concepts, he would ""dilute"" it with extra words or go off talking about ""relevant"" back story without wrapping it all up at the end. I had to review most of the videos a second time.",3
Financial Markets,By Emmanuel I,"Mar 15, 2019","I enjoyed the course thoroughly, it was a little difficult at first because my background isn't in finance. However, I pushed myself  to understand the concepts and principles such that I started to enjoy it. The lectures were really engaging. Now I have foundational understanding of finance upon which I can build my knowledge and also my ability to make informed application.",5
Financial Markets,By Anthony S,"Jan 10, 2019","Some parts of the course were informative.  Some were disappointing.  Replaying it in my mind now that I'm done, I feel that the course dwelt on the flaws of financial markets, rather than being an explanation of their workings.  It was an indictment of markets more than I would have expected, instead of being instructive toward them.  There was a section toward the end on ""critics of finance"".  Far less effort was made in defense of modern finance (a wonderful field).",3
Financial Markets,By Maumau B,"Jun 30, 2019","You can never get bored with Professor Shiller. He is very passionate about how things work or how to make it happen, and will convince you that everything in life needed finance. He likes history and is a lifelong learner.

Business Analysis & Process Management,By Thomas G,"Dec 15, 2020","""Pause and look at this doc ok welcome back now pause and do it yourself ok you now know how to write a business plan"". The instructor simply read a script verbatim with no punctuation, pauses, or personality. The whole thing was incredibly rushed, and ""rushed"" is not the same thing as ""fast paced"". Absolutely no justification for using the clunky Rhyme virtual desktop, as all you do is open a Google Doc and make a Lucid Chart account.

So really do the thinking of how to solve the requirements, testing it in a notebook out, reading the docs, discovering new cool stuff... But unfortunately my dream did not come true. The most exciting function was already provided and some of the answers were little bit of copy and paste instead of really recalling newly learned knowledge. Before this review I really wanted to give 4 out of 5 stars but after writing this review I will now give only 2 stars.

Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Basil K,"May 18, 2022","There is so much information missing in the labs in this course esp starting from Week 3. The videos it seems like were put together in a hurry with crucial information missing and labs are even worse than the videos. They are expecting one to find, set, unset files in extremely long scripts without providing any information on how it is done. Furthermore, there is little to no information given on why certain commands are called what they are called making this course not at all intuitive. I wish someone else has reviewed this course before putting it online. Such a wasted opportunity to educate people. ",1
Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Tyler M,"Jan 18, 2022","This need a lot more hands-on experience and explaining the *why* of commands. The course never explained any logic behind operators and commands, so it was never clear how everything worked.",3

Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Amanda W,"Aug 2, 2022","This course is terrible for beginners!! None of the modules go in depth, it was difficult to understand because none of the commands are explained, and the final project is super advanced for what is actually taught in the class. I feel like I learned almost nothing!",1
Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Mateusz K,"Jan 24, 2024","Everything that follows, is just my own personal opinion, if not stated otherwise. It is based on my observations and interactions with teaching staff in the course discussion forums (for the last few months).
This is a very poorly executed course.
As of today (23 Jan 2024) this course for me still does not meet the criteria of a ""good resource for learning"" the basics of Linux CLI and shell scripting (despite few minor improvements already applied).
Some of the topics are hastily skimmed through in the videos, and almost no mechanism presented in the course is thoroughly explained.
Many of the ""basic concepts"" for Bash (and other modern shells) like e.g. function definitions, proper error handling, etc., are not even included in the course.
The importance of using correct quotations for variable/parameter expansions is also never mentioned nor explained, although it should be considered essential ""best practice"".
Peer-graded Final Assignment instructions/""guide"" contains some errors and not fully tested solutions, advertised as ""working correctly"".
The similar can be said about grading rubrics for the final assignment - which additionally are not focused on the actual results of the code execution, but instead they're focused on the code ""looks"", as in its visual resemblance (being as close to ""identical"" as possible) to what the course's staff have written in the grading rubrics.
In some cases, if the teaching staff finds a question in a discussion forum a bit more ""inconvenient"" for them to answer (or they're not fully capable of providing the correct answer to it in a timely manner?), then they would rather:
a) ignore the question completely (the least they can do is to not get involved at all) or reply with something similar to: ""we'll investigate the issue and get back to you"" (the latter ""get back to you"" almost never happens for a ""more complicated"" question);
b) reply with some irrelevant, impractical, incorrect, or otherwise unuseful information;
c) politely ask, to not bring the subject up ever again, as it may ""overwhelm the learners"";
d) delete the post (most often containing a valid, correct answer to the question) from discussion forums (I see censorship as ""means of hiding incompetence""?)
e) repeat other learner's correct answer (sometimes only slightly modifying it);
f) use and completely rely on AI LLM (e.g. ChatGPT, Bard, or other) and answers provided by it (which are mostly ridiculous), without even basic output verification; 
g) and also (occasionally) delete any relevant corrections (made by more knowledgeable learners) to previous staff's posts/replies;
than admit to any mistakes in the course contents, admit to lack of expertise in the subject matter, and address the questions properly - e.g. by allowing open discussion on potential improvements to the course materials, and implementing all said improvements as soon as possible (after reviewing).
These practices have been reported, and as I was assured by the Coursera Support Team, this kind of inappropriate teaching staff's behaviors will be escalated further, so I'm awaiting next developments of the situation.
But I still think this kind of inappropriate behaviors are a clear example, of what gives (or rather should give) the Skill-Up Technologies Pvt. Ltd. / SkillUp Online (employers for the most of ""teaching staff"") a bad reputation.
This also might give Coursera courses and IBM Skills Network a really bad publicity in a long-run.
Teaching and following ""best practices"", and answering doubts with relevant, thorough, technical knowledge in the discussion forums of this course... is something you unlikely/rarely find coming from the teaching staff.
Generally, teaching staff don't seem to be fit for the job of thoroughly explaining the course materials and teaching the proper ""understanding"" of your mistakes (as hard as they try to be seen ""cooperative""),
but as I see it, they're better suited for
a) only requesting you to ""copy and paste"" their code samples, that they believe should work best as a ""correct solution"" in their opinions (side note, again, ""my opinion"" - their code doesn't work all that great, and is not written with all the ""best practices"" in mind) and 
b) deleting ""inconvenient"" posts from the discussion forums whenever they please.
To sum it up: in its current form, and with its current teaching staff replying in the discussion forums, I'd definitely not recommend this course to anyone, especially beginners. And I'd discourage seeking any ""great"" learning experience from Skill-Up Technologies Pvt. Ltd. / SkillUp Online - thus I'd strongly suggest searching for some other, better resources on the subjects regarding basics of working with Linux CLI and shell scripting.

Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Volkert d V,"Jan 19, 2024","I have a few qualms on this still good, dense course: (1) - there is a lot of jargon that is taken for granted. For someone new to programming - you can easily get lost - especially when certain programs are only mentioned once and then taken to be known (e.g. Kubernetes, RedHat etc.) A cheat sheet would be very welcome. (2) the videos, while clear, are very dense, and the voice is very mono-tone which became quite a turn-down. To make sure students capture it it would be helpful to have more cross-checking questions during the lecture. (3) the final peer reviewed exercise is tricky and the peer review system doesn't work that great. with all the talk on automated checking in IBMs DevOps course I would think an automated check would be more effective - and could actually point out to you what you did wrong. for example - I had trouble figuring out a certain line of code and I actually asked chatGPT - turns out I had one space too much. in another case I came up with a slightly different code which did the same job.

Introductory Human Physiology,By Maxine P M,"Jun 28, 2020","The primary reason for enrolling in the course was to enhance my knowledge base of human physiology. Although it has been many decades since I've taken anatomy and physiology as well as pathophysiology, I have taught it twice at the secondary level.  Upon reviewing the description of the course, it indicated that it was introductory, but knowledge of biology/science would be helpful, I thought it might be a great refresher course.  I beg to differ! This course WAS NOT introductory.  Let me give you the positives first: pdf's and readings were extremely helpful.  The negatives, the instructors were not impressive. One instructor talked absolutely too fast and much too often wouldn't complete the sentences OR she would repeat words or phrases that didn't make sense. I found it difficult to grasp the lecture when this instructor couldn't get through a sentence without stumbling over her thoughts, mumbling, trailing off and not finishing her sentence, etc. More often than not, the information provided in the lecture was inconsistent with the notes/pdf's. One other thing, she constantly smacked her mouth which was nerve-wrecking!  During the lectures, she would write on the powerpoints, which was either sloppy or not legible. After the fifth week, I honestly wanted to withdraw from the course, but decided to finish it out solely because it was half way completed and the time that had already been invested.  Many viewers gave the course 5 stars, I could not.  Although I completed the course with a 93.4% grade, the level of information was extensive, to some degree over the top.  The course needs to be restructured so that it stays within the context of an introductory course.  In my opinion, this course is more suitable for a first-second year medical student.  BTW, this is the sixth course that I have completed through Coursera, including a specialization.  Good luck!",2

Introductory Human Physiology,By Sylvia Q,"Jan 18, 2020","Great class - very dense, like drinking from a fire hose, but wow I learned a lot! I took this just because I wanted to learn more about how the body magically does what it does, every day, without me thinking about it. I had no prior experience in physiology or anatomy, so this required me to do a LOT of note-taking and a little bit of Googling on the side for further understanding. If a week's videos totaled 2 hours, I spent about 4-5 getting through them and taking notes. I should add that I did not use the forums regularly, but I saw that many students had, and that their questions were answered fairly promptly, often by Emma Jakoi herself. The end-of-unit quizzes always included questions which forced you to apply your new learning to cases, and these could be challenging! Thanks to Duke for making this great class available online for free.",5

Introductory Human Physiology,By Joshua S,"Dec 9, 2019"," It is so hard to learn from a professor who can't get through 2  sentences without stumbling over her thoughts, mumbling, trailing off  and not finishing her sentence, etc. Perhaps if she spent less time  pretending to be John Madden with her little board, she could focus on  being an effective orator. Perhaps the second professor would have been better, but after 2 hours of listening to Dr. Jakoi, I now have to contact Coursera to see if I can get a refund or switch courses.",1

Introductory Human Physiology,By Dustin J,"Aug 23, 2020","I'm a college freshman (majoring in nursing) and I took this course due to the pandemic. I found this course challenging since it focuses more on the physiology of the human body in more detail than a regular my anatomy and physiology class back in high school. This course isn't really an ""introductory"" course, you may need some background on science courses like chemistry, biology, anatomy, and physiology (So keep that in mind if you want to enroll). I have a limited background in science these courses (Biology, chemistry, etc) and finished this course, and yes it is possible to finish this course without knowing all about science stuff, it just took a little more effort to quickly learn science terms and stuff. With all of that, the course was great and for a nursing major like me really helped me developed surface-level knowledge about the function of the human body. Lectures are good, a little fast for me but they provide great PDF that I can refer to. Practice quizzes did help me a lot, but I hope that they provide feedback or explanation on why I got it wrong instead of just showing ""correct"" or ""incorrect"". It's worth my time learning physiology and I highly recommend it! Big thanks to the instructors and staff, especially Coursera for making this course free to the public!",5

Mimi Jakoi and  Jennifer Carbrey are magnificent in their field, and they both provide their tremendous insight to a high-functioning foundation level for the subject. However, if you are someone like me, a middle school science teacher who was only looking to find a novice level of physiology, you are going to get above and beyond what you imagined. I would definitely recommend this course to those who are highly invested in the subject, as it provides a great breadth of detail to 10 human systems. ",5

reading, and an intense note-taking all along. I highly recommend anyone who
wants a ‘warm-up’ in college physiology to do this course. This is perhaps a
first college level physiology, but it’s no way ‘introductory’. For a student with
mostly humanities background like me, it’s going to be a challenging course.

First Step Korean,By Mailine Y,"Oct 25, 2019","This class was very hard to follow. Pronunciation is key to any language. This course does not help you become even close to basic proficiency because there is no pronunciation key available. The worksheets are so hard to follow because it's all in Hangul with no pronunciation key or english pronunciation available. For a beginner course, this should have been standard- we don't know how to read Hangul and it shouldn't be expected during a beginners course. This course has a lot of room for improvement and would be great once they are implemented to become more user friendly. Also, rather than just using Hangul and English words in the videos, there should be pronunciation underneath the Hangul to make sure students are really getting the words correct instead of them trying to figure out word it is and referring to worksheets all the time. I did not have a good time learning the language because it was so frustrating trying to figure out what she was saying exactly- thus making the quizzes even more difficult!!",2

So in all, a good course if you can access some supplementary activities.  In fact, adding the quizlet flashcards to the lesson either before the lecture or before the quiz would be helpful for future students.  I plan to take the class again in order to master the material.",3

Financial Markets,By Deleted A,"Apr 23, 2019","This course is virtually worthless. I couldn't follow the lectures, and I have a PhD and have been a tenured professor for almost two decades. The online course is based on snippets taken from face-to-face lectures and breakout sessions, and the result is utter incoherence. The instructor frequently refers to concepts that have not yet been encountered in the online version of the course; makes extensive use of mathematical notations and formulas whose variables are never properly explained; and generally does a poor job of explaining the material. This online version of the Yale course was obviously slapped together with very little thought and production value; it's one of those unsuccessful attempts to bring in revenue on the cheap, creating an online version out of existing face-to-face material, rather than building a real online course from scratch. This was wasted money and time. This attempt to capitalize on the Yale brand is pathetic.    ",1

Financial Markets,By Tiyash B,"May 3, 2018","A great introductory level course which is recommended for anyone with a remote interest in finance irrespective of whether they have a background in finance or economics. The strongest point of this course is the simplicity with which it conveys the importance and relevance of finance in today's world. The instructor and his team have taken great care to introduce topics in a manner simple enough for anyone to understand. While the course content may not go very in-depth into how a particular stock market works, or how particular stocks move, it provides great insight into why the stock market is necessary and relevant in our current society and how human behavior and its expression through policy and law can result in both financial progress and also crisis.

Financial Markets,By Erik M,"Nov 4, 2018",This was really a great experience. A course taught by a valued teach. Enjoyed it all the way though I would have liked more mathematical and theoretical models. But then where do you end in a MOOC ?,5
Financial Markets,By Doan T L ,"May 26, 2019","It’s a good online course in Finance that I have never learned before. I have gained the basic knowledge of financial markets and their applications in reality. Absolutely right, finance is not just about making money that I thought before joining in this course, and as a popular opinion as well, it is more than that, it has much more meaningful. This course has brought to me the necessary skills to make more rational decisions in my life, in my future career, I think. It’s also helped me to realize how I should work in this sector to serve the right purposes, to make the people living around me to be better. And it’s true that educational finance is very important to everyone. Professor Robert Shiller is an amazing teacher, many thanks to Professor Robert Shiller and Yale’s Financial Markets Course team. I highly recommend taking this course! ",5
Financial Markets,By Stefano E,"Mar 17, 2019","Probably the best financial market course on coursera. Intense and very rich in content. Too much,  though. Many topics would require more than a 10 minute video to be properly understood, and some lectures were difficult to follow. I'd probably reduce the content and focus on less topics but giving them more time.",3

Financial Markets,By James N,"Jun 7, 2019","From a knowledge perspective, I have learned a lot about financial markets, why various financial instruments exist, and the applications/implications of them. With all due respect to the lecturer, he was not very engaging and did not really provide emphasis on key concepts to make it stick. When explaining the concepts, he would ""dilute"" it with extra words or go off talking about ""relevant"" back story without wrapping it all up at the end. I had to review most of the videos a second time.",3
Financial Markets,By Emmanuel I,"Mar 15, 2019","I enjoyed the course thoroughly, it was a little difficult at first because my background isn't in finance. However, I pushed myself  to understand the concepts and principles such that I started to enjoy it. The lectures were really engaging. Now I have foundational understanding of finance upon which I can build my knowledge and also my ability to make informed application.",5
Financial Markets,By Anthony S,"Jan 10, 2019","Some parts of the course were informative.  Some were disappointing.  Replaying it in my mind now that I'm done, I feel that the course dwelt on the flaws of financial markets, rather than being an explanation of their workings.  It was an indictment of markets more than I would have expected, instead of being instructive toward them.  There was a section toward the end on ""critics of finance"".  Far less effort was made in defense of modern finance (a wonderful field).",3
Financial Markets,By Maumau B,"Jun 30, 2019","You can never get bored with Professor Shiller. He is very passionate about how things work or how to make it happen, and will convince you that everything in life needed finance. He likes history and is a lifelong learner. I rated 5 stars because he made it simple for people to learn regardless of ages or education. ",5
Business Analysis & Process Management,By Thomas G,"Dec 15, 2020","""Pause and look at this doc ok welcome back now pause and do it yourself ok you now know how to write a business plan"". The instructor simply read a script verbatim with no punctuation, pauses, or personality. The whole thing was incredibly rushed, and ""rushed"" is not the same thing as ""fast paced"". Absolutely no justification for using the clunky Rhyme virtual desktop, as all you do is open a Google Doc and make a Lucid Chart account. Why would I log into my email and set up another account in your virtual desktop?",1
Business Analysis & Process Management,By Gisela W,"Dec 19, 2020","I like the hands-on platform and the approach of following along with the instructor side by side. However, the instructor speaks way too fast. I lowered the speed to 0.7 and was still struggling to follow. Also, at times the questions/instructions are not 100% clear or confusing so that I wasn't sure what to do and just kept watching. The content is quite superficial.

Business Analysis & Process Management,By Deleted A,"Feb 11, 2021","Coursera please remove this course!

It is not in depth at all and does a stunningly poor job at building real understanding and competency. The videos and labs are full of sloppiness and errors... again, not living up to the IBM name.

"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Aykut Ö,"Mar 4, 2019","  As in the other parts of the certificate, the tasks are simply too easy. The content in the videos (many typos!!!!) are really valuable but the tasks man... Only the surface of the surface will be discussed, no deeping down into the wild. In this course the libraries numpy and pandas are presented but in the final assignment we actually don't needed the libs... When I read the description of the final assignment, I was excited because I assumed we will need to code EVERYTHING ourselves. So really do the thinking of how to solve the requirements, testing it in a notebook out, reading the docs, discovering new cool stuff... But unfortunately my dream did not come true. The most exciting function was already provided and some of the answers were little bit of copy and paste instead of really recalling newly learned knowledge. Before this review I really wanted to give 4 out of 5 stars but after writing this review I will now give only 2 stars.

I feel like I learned almost nothing!",1
Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Mateusz K,"Jan 24, 2024","Everything that follows, is just my own personal opinion, if not stated otherwise. It is based on my observations and interactions with teaching staff in the course discussion forums (for the last few months).
This is a very poorly executed course.
As of today (23 Jan 2024) this course for me still does not meet the criteria of a ""good resource for learning"" the basics of Linux CLI and shell scripting (despite few minor improvements already applied).
Some of the topics are hastily skimmed through in the videos, and almost no mechanism presented in the course is thoroughly explained.
Many of the ""basic concepts"" for Bash (and other modern shells) like e.g. function definitions, proper error handling, etc., are not even included in the course.
The importance of using correct quotations for variable/parameter expansions is also never mentioned nor explained, although it should be considered essential ""best practice"".
Peer-graded Final Assignment instructions/""guide"" contains some errors and not fully tested solutions, advertised as ""working correctly"".
The similar can be said about grading rubrics for the final assignment - which additionally are not focused on the actual results of the code execution, but instead they're focused on the code ""looks"", as in its visual resemblance (being as close to ""identical"" as possible) to what the course's staff have written in the grading rubrics.
In some cases, if the teaching staff finds a question in a discussion forum a bit more ""inconvenient"" for them to answer (or they're not fully capable of providing the correct answer to it in a timely manner?), then they would rather:
a) ignore the question completely (the least they can do is to not get involved at all) or reply with something similar to: ""we'll investigate the issue and get back to you"" (the latter ""get back to you"" almost never happens for a ""more complicated"" question);
b) reply with some irrelevant, impractical, incorrect, or otherwise unuseful information;
c) politely ask, to not bring the subject up ever again, as it may ""overwhelm the learners"";
d) delete the post (most often containing a valid, correct answer to the question) from discussion forums (I see censorship as ""means of hiding incompetence""?)
e) repeat other learner's correct answer (sometimes only slightly modifying it);
f) use and completely rely on AI LLM (e.g. ChatGPT, Bard, or other) and answers provided by it (which are mostly ridiculous), without even basic output verification; 
g) and also (occasionally) delete any relevant corrections (made by more knowledgeable learners) to previous staff's posts/replies;
than admit to any mistakes in the course contents, admit to lack of expertise in the subject matter, and address the questions properly - e.g. by allowing open discussion on potential improvements to the course materials, and implementing all said improvements as soon as possible (after reviewing).
These practices have been reported, and as I was assured by the Coursera Support Team, this kind of inappropriate teaching staff's behaviors will be escalated further, so I'm awaiting next developments of the situation.
But I still think this kind of inappropriate behaviors are a clear example, of what gives (or rather should give) the Skill-Up Technologies Pvt. Ltd. / SkillUp Online (employers for the most of ""teaching staff"") a bad reputation.
This also might give Coursera courses and IBM Skills Network a really bad publicity in a long-run.
Teaching and following ""best practices"", and answering doubts with relevant, thorough, technical knowledge in the discussion forums of this course... is something you unlikely/rarely find coming from the teaching staff.
Generally, teaching staff don't seem to be fit for the job of thoroughly explaining the course materials and teaching the proper ""understanding"" of your mistakes (as hard as they try to be seen ""cooperative""),
but as I see it, they're better suited for
a) only requesting you to ""copy and paste"" their code samples, that they believe should work best as a ""correct solution"" in their opinions (side note, again, ""my opinion"" - their code doesn't work all that great, and is not written with all the ""best practices"" in mind) and 
b) deleting ""inconvenient"" posts from the discussion forums whenever they please.
To sum it up: in its current form, and with its current teaching staff replying in the discussion forums, I'd definitely not recommend this course to anyone, especially beginners. And I'd discourage seeking any ""great"" learning experience from Skill-Up Technologies Pvt. Ltd. / SkillUp Online - thus I'd strongly suggest searching for some other, better resources on the subjects regarding basics of working with Linux CLI and shell scripting.

The course content seemed incomplete, lacking the depth and breadth that I have come to expect from IBM courses. This made it difficult to gain a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.",2

Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Volkert d V,"Jan 19, 2024","I have a few qualms on this still good, dense course: (1) - there is a lot of jargon that is taken for granted. For someone new to programming - you can easily get lost - especially when certain programs are only mentioned once and then taken to be known (e.g. Kubernetes, RedHat etc.) A cheat sheet would be very welcome. (2) the videos, while clear, are very dense, and the voice is very mono-tone which became quite a turn-down. To make sure students capture it it would be helpful to have more cross-checking questions during the lecture. (3) the final peer reviewed exercise is tricky and the peer review system doesn't work that great. with all the talk on automated checking in IBMs DevOps course I would think an automated check would be more effective - and could actually point out to you what you did wrong. for example - I had trouble figuring out a certain line of code and I actually asked chatGPT - turns out I had one space too much. in another case I came up with a slightly different code which did the same job.

Introductory Human Physiology,By Kin I R N,"Apr 16, 2018",I am an incoming medical student here in the Philippines and this course has provided me with enough background about the human body and the underlying machinery of every system associated with it. ,5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Maxine P M,"Jun 28, 2020","The primary reason for enrolling in the course was to enhance my knowledge base of human physiology. Although it has been many decades since I've taken anatomy and physiology as well as pathophysiology, I have taught it twice at the secondary level.  Upon reviewing the description of the course, it indicated that it was introductory, but knowledge of biology/science would be helpful, I thought it might be a great refresher course.  I beg to differ! This course WAS NOT introductory.  Let me give you the positives first: pdf's and readings were extremely helpful.  The negatives, the instructors were not impressive. One instructor talked absolutely too fast and much too often wouldn't complete the sentences OR she would repeat words or phrases that didn't make sense. I found it difficult to grasp the lecture when this instructor couldn't get through a sentence without stumbling over her thoughts, mumbling, trailing off and not finishing her sentence, etc. More often than not, the information provided in the lecture was inconsistent with the notes/pdf's. One other thing, she constantly smacked her mouth which was nerve-wrecking!  During the lectures, she would write on the powerpoints, which was either sloppy or not legible. After the fifth week, I honestly wanted to withdraw from the course, but decided to finish it out solely because it was half way completed and the time that had already been invested.  Many viewers gave the course 5 stars, I could not.  Although I completed the course with a 93.4% grade, the level of information was extensive, to some degree over the top.  The course needs to be restructured so that it stays within the context of an introductory course.  In my opinion, this course is more suitable for a first-second year medical student.  BTW, this is the sixth course that I have completed through Coursera, including a specialization.  Good luck!",2

Introductory Human Physiology,By Sylvia Q,"Jan 18, 2020","Great class - very dense, like drinking from a fire hose, but wow I learned a lot! I took this just because I wanted to learn more about how the body magically does what it does, every day, without me thinking about it. I had no prior experience in physiology or anatomy, so this required me to do a LOT of note-taking and a little bit of Googling on the side for further understanding. If a week's videos totaled 2 hours, I spent about 4-5 getting through them and taking notes. I should add that I did not use the forums regularly, but I saw that many students had, and that their questions were answered fairly promptly, often by Emma Jakoi herself. The end-of-unit quizzes always included questions which forced you to apply your new learning to cases, and these could be challenging! Thanks to Duke for making this great class available online for free.",5

Introductory Human Physiology,By Joshua S,"Dec 9, 2019"," It is so hard to learn from a professor who can't get through 2  sentences without stumbling over her thoughts, mumbling, trailing off  and not finishing her sentence, etc. Perhaps if she spent less time  pretending to be John Madden with her little board, she could focus on  being an effective orator. Perhaps the second professor would have been better, but after 2 hours of listening to Dr. Jakoi, I now have to contact Coursera to see if I can get a refund or switch courses.",1
Introductory Human Physiology,By Anastasiia N,"Oct 24, 2015","The effect of this course in understanding the body physiology and understanding the terminology of other courses can be compared to learning to read.

Introductory Human Physiology,By Dustin J,"Aug 23, 2020","I'm a college freshman (majoring in nursing) and I took this course due to the pandemic. I found this course challenging since it focuses more on the physiology of the human body in more detail than a regular my anatomy and physiology class back in high school. This course isn't really an ""introductory"" course, you may need some background on science courses like chemistry, biology, anatomy, and physiology (So keep that in mind if you want to enroll). I have a limited background in science these courses (Biology, chemistry, etc) and finished this course, and yes it is possible to finish this course without knowing all about science stuff, it just took a little more effort to quickly learn science terms and stuff. With all of that, the course was great and for a nursing major like me really helped me developed surface-level knowledge about the function of the human body. Lectures are good, a little fast for me but they provide great PDF that I can refer to. Practice quizzes did help me a lot, but I hope that they provide feedback or explanation on why I got it wrong instead of just showing ""correct"" or ""incorrect"". It's worth my time learning physiology and I highly recommend it! Big thanks to the instructors and staff, especially Coursera for making this course free to the public!",5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Karen J,"May 10, 2020","Definitely, this is not an introductory course. Actually, you need some prior background in physiology, biology, chemistry, anatomy before taking it. It is also very challenging!  ",5

All the lectures are very professionally conducted with clear notes in the resources.  Many times, video lectures provided very good external cases beyond the texts.  I must also respect that both of you continue with the lectures despite hearing coughing many times throughout.  Great professionalism demonstrated, even in such coursera.co course.",5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Christine A,"Apr 20, 2020","This course is excellent, if physiology is something you need for your career/personal interest. Mimi Jakoi and  Jennifer Carbrey are magnificent in their field, and they both provide their tremendous insight to a high-functioning foundation level for the subject. However, if you are someone like me, a middle school science teacher who was only looking to find a novice level of physiology, you are going to get above and beyond what you imagined. I would definitely recommend this course to those who are highly invested in the subject, as it provides a great breadth of detail to 10 human systems. ",5

amount of information each video each module. For each week’s two to three
video hours, I spent 5 to 6 hours researching through googling or textbook
reading, and an intense note-taking all along. I highly recommend anyone who
wants a ‘warm-up’ in college physiology to do this course. This is perhaps a
first college level physiology, but it’s no way ‘introductory’. For a student with
mostly humanities background like me, it’s going to be a challenging course.

First Step Korean,By Mailine Y,"Oct 25, 2019","This class was very hard to follow. Pronunciation is key to any language. This course does not help you become even close to basic proficiency because there is no pronunciation key available. The worksheets are so hard to follow because it's all in Hangul with no pronunciation key or english pronunciation available. For a beginner course, this should have been standard- we don't know how to read Hangul and it shouldn't be expected during a beginners course. This course has a lot of room for improvement and would be great once they are implemented to become more user friendly. Also, rather than just using Hangul and English words in the videos, there should be pronunciation underneath the Hangul to make sure students are really getting the words correct instead of them trying to figure out word it is and referring to worksheets all the time. I did not have a good time learning the language because it was so frustrating trying to figure out what she was saying exactly- thus making the quizzes even more difficult!!",2

Financial Markets,By Deleted A,"Apr 23, 2019","This course is virtually worthless. I couldn't follow the lectures, and I have a PhD and have been a tenured professor for almost two decades. The online course is based on snippets taken from face-to-face lectures and breakout sessions, and the result is utter incoherence. The instructor frequently refers to concepts that have not yet been encountered in the online version of the course; makes extensive use of mathematical notations and formulas whose variables are never properly explained; and generally does a poor job of explaining the material. This online version of the Yale course was obviously slapped together with very little thought and production value; it's one of those unsuccessful attempts to bring in revenue on the cheap, creating an online version out of existing face-to-face material, rather than building a real online course from scratch. This was wasted money and time. This attempt to capitalize on the Yale brand is pathetic.    ",1

Financial Markets,By Tiyash B,"May 3, 2018","A great introductory level course which is recommended for anyone with a remote interest in finance irrespective of whether they have a background in finance or economics. The strongest point of this course is the simplicity with which it conveys the importance and relevance of finance in today's world. The instructor and his team have taken great care to introduce topics in a manner simple enough for anyone to understand. While the course content may not go very in-depth into how a particular stock market works, or how particular stocks move, it provides great insight into why the stock market is necessary and relevant in our current society and how human behavior and its expression through policy and law can result in both financial progress and also crisis. ",5
Financial Markets,By Erik M,"Nov 4, 2018",This was really a great experience. A course taught by a valued teach. Enjoyed it all the way though I would have liked more mathematical and theoretical models. But then where do you end in a MOOC ?,5
Financial Markets,By Doan T L ,"May 26, 2019","It’s a good online course in Finance that I have never learned before. I have gained the basic knowledge of financial markets and their applications in reality. Absolutely right, finance is not just about making money that I thought before joining in this course, and as a popular opinion as well, it is more than that, it has much more meaningful. This course has brought to me the necessary skills to make more rational decisions in my life, in my future career, I think. It’s also helped me to realize how I should work in this sector to serve the right purposes, to make the people living around me to be better. And it’s true that educational finance is very important to everyone. Professor Robert Shiller is an amazing teacher, many thanks to Professor Robert Shiller and Yale’s Financial Markets Course team. I highly recommend taking this course! ",5
Financial Markets,By Stefano E,"Mar 17, 2019","Probably the best financial market course on coursera. Intense and very rich in content. Too much,  though. Many topics would require more than a 10 minute video to be properly understood, and some lectures were difficult to follow. I'd probably reduce the content and focus on less topics but giving them more time.",3
Financial Markets,By Aniket G,"May 20, 2019","It was not very interesting. The course needs to be more self-explanatory, with real world examples, and not dull",1
Financial Markets,By David S,"May 29, 2020",I find the professor is hard to understand because he is so slow in making a point.  I have listened to a few lectures and have given up.  I am going to look for another course.,1

Financial Markets,By Aayushi a,"Jun 16, 2020","Through this course, I have learned not only technical financial terms but much deeper meaning of the financial markets which I always wanted to understand. I feel very lucky that I took this course.",5
Financial Markets,By James N,"Jun 7, 2019","From a knowledge perspective, I have learned a lot about financial markets, why various financial instruments exist, and the applications/implications of them. With all due respect to the lecturer, he was not very engaging and did not really provide emphasis on key concepts to make it stick. When explaining the concepts, he would ""dilute"" it with extra words or go off talking about ""relevant"" back story without wrapping it all up at the end. I had to review most of the videos a second time.",3
Financial Markets,By Emmanuel I,"Mar 15, 2019","I enjoyed the course thoroughly, it was a little difficult at first because my background isn't in finance. However, I pushed myself  to understand the concepts and principles such that I started to enjoy it. The lectures were really engaging. Now I have foundational understanding of finance upon which I can build my knowledge and also my ability to make informed application.",5
Financial Markets,By Anthony S,"Jan 10, 2019","Some parts of the course were informative.  Some were disappointing.  Replaying it in my mind now that I'm done, I feel that the course dwelt on the flaws of financial markets, rather than being an explanation of their workings.  It was an indictment of markets more than I would have expected, instead of being instructive toward them.  There was a section toward the end on ""critics of finance"".  Far less effort was made in defense of modern finance (a wonderful field).",3
Financial Markets,By Maumau B,"Jun 30, 2019","You can never get bored with Professor Shiller. He is very passionate about how things work or how to make it happen, and will convince you that everything in life needed finance. He likes history and is a lifelong learner. I rated 5 stars because he made it simple for people to learn regardless of ages or education. ",5
Business Analysis & Process Management,By Thomas G,"Dec 15, 2020","""Pause and look at this doc ok welcome back now pause and do it yourself ok you now know how to write a business plan"". The instructor simply read a script verbatim with no punctuation, pauses, or personality. The whole thing was incredibly rushed, and ""rushed"" is not the same thing as ""fast paced"". Absolutely no justification for using the clunky Rhyme virtual desktop, as all you do is open a Google Doc and make a Lucid Chart account. Why would I log into my email and set up another account in your virtual desktop?",1
Business Analysis & Process Management,By Gisela W,"Dec 19, 2020","I like the hands-on platform and the approach of following along with the instructor side by side. However, the instructor speaks way too fast. I lowered the speed to 0.7 and was still struggling to follow. Also, at times the questions/instructions are not 100% clear or confusing so that I wasn't sure what to do and just kept watching. The content is quite superficial. The project does give you some guidance in modeling a simple business process using Lucidchart which I appreciate.",2
Business Analysis & Process Management,By Deleted A,"Feb 11, 2021","Coursera please remove this course!

"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By David J,"Apr 20, 2019","Course focuses more on forcing you to sign up for various IBM cloud tools than learning python.  The final assignment has a 300+ reply thread in the discussion forum because you are graded on the ability to integrate your IBM Watson Notebook with IBM cloud storage, but the instructions have multiple errors, such as not working if you provision your storage in the wrong region.",1

The slide is completely unclear and there are some small mistakes in that. And the final project is aimless, I don't know why you come up with such a project for the beginner. Anyway, I'm so disappointed with IBM and this course. ",1
"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Julian L G,"Jan 4, 2019","It is amazing how bad this is considering that it is marketed as an IBM product. This is not the level of quality people expect when they hear the name IBM! You'd be better off paying 9.99 for a Udemy course than taking this course. It is not in depth at all and does a stunningly poor job at building real understanding and competency. The videos and labs are full of sloppiness and errors... again, not living up to the IBM name. I don't know about y'all, but I'm probably never going to pay money for a coursera course again... not really worth it.",1

"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Aykut Ö,"Mar 4, 2019","  As in the other parts of the certificate, the tasks are simply too easy. The content in the videos (many typos!!!!) are really valuable but the tasks man... Only the surface of the surface will be discussed, no deeping down into the wild. In this course the libraries numpy and pandas are presented but in the final assignment we actually don't needed the libs... When I read the description of the final assignment, I was excited because I assumed we will need to code EVERYTHING ourselves. So really do the thinking of how to solve the requirements, testing it in a notebook out, reading the docs, discovering new cool stuff... But unfortunately my dream did not come true. The most exciting function was already provided and some of the answers were little bit of copy and paste instead of really recalling newly learned knowledge. Before this review I really wanted to give 4 out of 5 stars but after writing this review I will now give only 2 stars. Actually, 2 stars are in my opinion unfair, since the creators have put a lot of time and love in the course content. Unfortunately, so much potential is thrown away  ",2

"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Steve O,"Oct 31, 2018","The IBM cloud ""service"" leaves much to be desired. Multiple times I've experienced outages while I was in the middle of lab assignments. It's a paid course where they give you ""free"" credits to do the course work in their cloud ""service.""

I spend many hours on a number of evenings figuring what was meant. If this lead to constructive learning, I'd be OK with it. But now it was just a long egg-hunt to figure out how I was to post something using idiosyncratic IBM infrastructure which taught me little about Python. Was this course even test driven?",1

Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Basil K,"May 18, 2022","There is so much information missing in the labs in this course esp starting from Week 3. The videos it seems like were put together in a hurry with crucial information missing and labs are even worse than the videos. They are expecting one to find, set, unset files in extremely long scripts without providing any information on how it is done. Furthermore, there is little to no information given on why certain commands are called what they are called making this course not at all intuitive. I wish someone else has reviewed this course before putting it online. Such a wasted opportunity to educate people. ",1
Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Tyler M,"Jan 18, 2022","This need a lot more hands-on experience and explaining the *why* of commands. The course never explained any logic behind operators and commands, so it was never clear how everything worked.",3

None of the modules go in depth, it was difficult to understand because none of the commands are explained, and the final project is super advanced for what is actually taught in the class. I feel like I learned almost nothing!",1
Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Mateusz K,"Jan 24, 2024","Everything that follows, is just my own personal opinion, if not stated otherwise. It is based on my observations and interactions with teaching staff in the course discussion forums (for the last few months).
This is a very poorly executed course.
As of today (23 Jan 2024) this course for me still does not meet the criteria of a ""good resource for learning"" the basics of Linux CLI and shell scripting (despite few minor improvements already applied).
Some of the topics are hastily skimmed through in the videos, and almost no mechanism presented in the course is thoroughly explained.
Many of the ""basic concepts"" for Bash (and other modern shells) like e.g. function definitions, proper error handling, etc., are not even included in the course.
The importance of using correct quotations for variable/parameter expansions is also never mentioned nor explained, although it should be considered essential ""best practice"".
Peer-graded Final Assignment instructions/""guide"" contains some errors and not fully tested solutions, advertised as ""working correctly"".
The similar can be said about grading rubrics for the final assignment - which additionally are not focused on the actual results of the code execution, but instead they're focused on the code ""looks"", as in its visual resemblance (being as close to ""identical"" as possible) to what the course's staff have written in the grading rubrics.
In some cases, if the teaching staff finds a question in a discussion forum a bit more ""inconvenient"" for them to answer (or they're not fully capable of providing the correct answer to it in a timely manner?), then they would rather:
a) ignore the question completely (the least they can do is to not get involved at all) or reply with something similar to: ""we'll investigate the issue and get back to you"" (the latter ""get back to you"" almost never happens for a ""more complicated"" question);
b) reply with some irrelevant, impractical, incorrect, or otherwise unuseful information;
c) politely ask, to not bring the subject up ever again, as it may ""overwhelm the learners"";
d) delete the post (most often containing a valid, correct answer to the question) from discussion forums (I see censorship as ""means of hiding incompetence""?)
e) repeat other learner's correct answer (sometimes only slightly modifying it);
f) use and completely rely on AI LLM (e.g. ChatGPT, Bard, or other) and answers provided by it (which are mostly ridiculous), without even basic output verification; 
g) and also (occasionally) delete any relevant corrections (made by more knowledgeable learners) to previous staff's posts/replies;
than admit to any mistakes in the course contents, admit to lack of expertise in the subject matter, and address the questions properly - e.g. by allowing open discussion on potential improvements to the course materials, and implementing all said improvements as soon as possible (after reviewing).
These practices have been reported, and as I was assured by the Coursera Support Team, this kind of inappropriate teaching staff's behaviors will be escalated further, so I'm awaiting next developments of the situation.
But I still think this kind of inappropriate behaviors are a clear example, of what gives (or rather should give) the Skill-Up Technologies Pvt. Ltd. / SkillUp Online (employers for the most of ""teaching staff"") a bad reputation.
This also might give Coursera courses and IBM Skills Network a really bad publicity in a long-run.
Teaching and following ""best practices"", and answering doubts with relevant, thorough, technical knowledge in the discussion forums of this course... is something you unlikely/rarely find coming from the teaching staff.
Generally, teaching staff don't seem to be fit for the job of thoroughly explaining the course materials and teaching the proper ""understanding"" of your mistakes (as hard as they try to be seen ""cooperative""),
but as I see it, they're better suited for
a) only requesting you to ""copy and paste"" their code samples, that they believe should work best as a ""correct solution"" in their opinions (side note, again, ""my opinion"" - their code doesn't work all that great, and is not written with all the ""best practices"" in mind) and 
b) deleting ""inconvenient"" posts from the discussion forums whenever they please.
To sum it up: in its current form, and with its current teaching staff replying in the discussion forums, I'd definitely not recommend this course to anyone, especially beginners. And I'd discourage seeking any ""great"" learning experience from Skill-Up Technologies Pvt. Ltd. / SkillUp Online - thus I'd strongly suggest searching for some other, better resources on the subjects regarding basics of working with Linux CLI and shell scripting.

Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Volkert d V,"Jan 19, 2024","I have a few qualms on this still good, dense course: (1) - there is a lot of jargon that is taken for granted.

(2) the videos, while clear, are very dense, and the voice is very mono-tone which became quite a turn-down. To make sure students capture it it would be helpful to have more cross-checking questions during the lecture. (3) the final peer reviewed exercise is tricky and the peer review system doesn't work that great. with all the talk on automated checking in IBMs DevOps course I would think an automated check would be more effective - and could actually point out to you what you did wrong. for example - I had trouble figuring out a certain line of code and I actually asked chatGPT - turns out I had one space too much. in another case I came up with a slightly different code which did the same job. My peer reviewer rated it wrong.",3

Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Muhammad H,"Apr 2, 2023","Overall, the course is very nicely designed and implemented except for the last week where they have shell scripting assignment.

Introductory Human Physiology,By Kin I R N,"Apr 16, 2018",I am an incoming medical student here in the Philippines and this course has provided me with enough background about the human body and the underlying machinery of every system associated with it. ,5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Maxine P M,"Jun 28, 2020","The primary reason for enrolling in the course was to enhance my knowledge base of human physiology. Although it has been many decades since I've taken anatomy and physiology as well as pathophysiology, I have taught it twice at the secondary level.  Upon reviewing the description of the course, it indicated that it was introductory, but knowledge of biology/science would be helpful, I thought it might be a great refresher course.  I beg to differ! This course WAS NOT introductory.  Let me give you the positives first: pdf's and readings were extremely helpful.  The negatives, the instructors were not impressive. One instructor talked absolutely too fast and much too often wouldn't complete the sentences OR she would repeat words or phrases that didn't make sense. I found it difficult to grasp the lecture when this instructor couldn't get through a sentence without stumbling over her thoughts, mumbling, trailing off and not finishing her sentence, etc. More often than not, the information provided in the lecture was inconsistent with the notes/pdf's. One other thing, she constantly smacked her mouth which was nerve-wrecking!  During the lectures, she would write on the powerpoints, which was either sloppy or not legible. After the fifth week, I honestly wanted to withdraw from the course, but decided to finish it out solely because it was half way completed and the time that had already been invested.  Many viewers gave the course 5 stars, I could not.  Although I completed the course with a 93.4% grade, the level of information was extensive, to some degree over the top.  The course needs to be restructured so that it stays within the context of an introductory course.  In my opinion, this course is more suitable for a first-second year medical student.  BTW, this is the sixth course that I have completed through Coursera, including a specialization.  Good luck!",2

Introductory Human Physiology,By Sylvia Q,"Jan 18, 2020","Great class - very dense, like drinking from a fire hose, but wow I learned a lot! I took this just because I wanted to learn more about how the body magically does what it does, every day, without me thinking about it. I had no prior experience in physiology or anatomy, so this required me to do a LOT of note-taking and a little bit of Googling on the side for further understanding. If a week's videos totaled 2 hours, I spent about 4-5 getting through them and taking notes. I should add that I did not use the forums regularly, but I saw that many students had, and that their questions were answered fairly promptly, often by Emma Jakoi herself. The end-of-unit quizzes always included questions which forced you to apply your new learning to cases, and these could be challenging! Thanks to Duke for making this great class available online for free.",5

Introductory Human Physiology,By Joshua S,"Dec 9, 2019"," It is so hard to learn from a professor who can't get through 2  sentences without stumbling over her thoughts, mumbling, trailing off  and not finishing her sentence, etc. Perhaps if she spent less time  pretending to be John Madden with her little board, she could focus on  being an effective orator. Perhaps the second professor would have been better, but after 2 hours of listening to Dr. Jakoi, I now have to contact Coursera to see if I can get a refund or switch courses.",1
Introductory Human Physiology,By Anastasiia N,"Oct 24, 2015","The effect of this course in understanding the body physiology and understanding the terminology of other courses can be compared to learning to read.

Introductory Human Physiology,By Dustin J,"Aug 23, 2020","I'm a college freshman (majoring in nursing) and I took this course due to the pandemic. I found this course challenging since it focuses more on the physiology of the human body in more detail than a regular my anatomy and physiology class back in high school. This course isn't really an ""introductory"" course, you may need some background on science courses like chemistry, biology, anatomy, and physiology (So keep that in mind if you want to enroll). I have a limited background in science these courses (Biology, chemistry, etc) and finished this course, and yes it is possible to finish this course without knowing all about science stuff, it just took a little more effort to quickly learn science terms and stuff. With all of that, the course was great and for a nursing major like me really helped me developed surface-level knowledge about the function of the human body. Lectures are good, a little fast for me but they provide great PDF that I can refer to. Practice quizzes did help me a lot, but I hope that they provide feedback or explanation on why I got it wrong instead of just showing ""correct"" or ""incorrect"". It's worth my time learning physiology and I highly recommend it! Big thanks to the instructors and staff, especially Coursera for making this course free to the public!",5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Karen J,"May 10, 2020","Definitely, this is not an introductory course. Actually, you need some prior background in physiology, biology, chemistry, anatomy before taking it. It is also very challenging!  ",5

All the lectures are very professionally conducted with clear notes in the resources.  Many times, video lectures provided very good external cases beyond the texts.  I must also respect that both of you continue with the lectures despite hearing coughing many times throughout.  Great professionalism demonstrated, even in such coursera.co course.",5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Christine A,"Apr 20, 2020","This course is excellent, if physiology is something you need for your career/personal interest. Mimi Jakoi and  Jennifer Carbrey are magnificent in their field, and they both provide their tremendous insight to a high-functioning foundation level for the subject. However, if you are someone like me, a middle school science teacher who was only looking to find a novice level of physiology, you are going to get above and beyond what you imagined. I would definitely recommend this course to those who are highly invested in the subject, as it provides a great breadth of detail to 10 human systems. ",5

Introductory Human Physiology,By Calista L,"Oct 8, 2020","Great things first: It’s a great course, with quite an
amount of information each video each module. For each week’s two to three
video hours, I spent 5 to 6 hours researching through googling or textbook
reading, and an intense note-taking all along. I highly recommend anyone who
wants a ‘warm-up’ in college physiology to do this course. This is perhaps a
first college level physiology, but it’s no way ‘introductory’. For a student with
mostly humanities background like me, it’s going to be a challenging course.
But it is really worth doing.",5

First Step Korean,By Mailine Y,"Oct 25, 2019","This class was very hard to follow. Pronunciation is key to any language. This course does not help you become even close to basic proficiency because there is no pronunciation key available. The worksheets are so hard to follow because it's all in Hangul with no pronunciation key or english pronunciation available. For a beginner course, this should have been standard- we don't know how to read Hangul and it shouldn't be expected during a beginners course. This course has a lot of room for improvement and would be great once they are implemented to become more user friendly. Also, rather than just using Hangul and English words in the videos, there should be pronunciation underneath the Hangul to make sure students are really getting the words correct instead of them trying to figure out word it is and referring to worksheets all the time. I did not have a good time learning the language because it was so frustrating trying to figure out what she was saying exactly- thus making the quizzes even more difficult!!",2

I do think that you have to come into this course with an understanding of the Korean alphabet and basic knowledge of how to compose and read letters. Once you have that down, this course definitely helps you begin to move forward in becoming fluent with verbal and written comprehension. You definitely have to practice and repeat your practice consistently to retain your new knowledge. I love this course. Thank you!",5

I had to watch the videos at 75% speed in order to figure out what was actually said, as I have never heard any Korean before.  I used the quizlet flashcards and some youtube videos in order to learn the material, as the ""lecture notes"" were not always very helpful.  So in all, a good course if you can access some supplementary activities.  In fact, adding the quizlet flashcards to the lesson either before the lecture or before the quiz would be helpful for future students.  I plan to take the class again in order to master the material.",3

Financial Markets,By Deleted A,"Apr 23, 2019","This course is virtually worthless. I couldn't follow the lectures, and I have a PhD and have been a tenured professor for almost two decades. The online course is based on snippets taken from face-to-face lectures and breakout sessions, and the result is utter incoherence. The instructor frequently refers to concepts that have not yet been encountered in the online version of the course; makes extensive use of mathematical notations and formulas whose variables are never properly explained; and generally does a poor job of explaining the material. This online version of the Yale course was obviously slapped together with very little thought and production value; it's one of those unsuccessful attempts to bring in revenue on the cheap, creating an online version out of existing face-to-face material, rather than building a real online course from scratch. This was wasted money and time. This attempt to capitalize on the Yale brand is pathetic.    ",1

The strongest point of this course is the simplicity with which it conveys the importance and relevance of finance in today's world. The instructor and his team have taken great care to introduce topics in a manner simple enough for anyone to understand. While the course content may not go very in-depth into how a particular stock market works, or how particular stocks move, it provides great insight into why the stock market is necessary and relevant in our current society and how human behavior and its expression through policy and law can result in both financial progress and also crisis.

This course has brought to me the necessary skills to make more rational decisions in my life, in my future career, I think. It’s also helped me to realize how I should work in this sector to serve the right purposes, to make the people living around me to be better. And it’s true that educational finance is very important to everyone. Professor Robert Shiller is an amazing teacher, many thanks to Professor Robert Shiller and Yale’s Financial Markets Course team.

Financial Markets,By Anthony S,"Jan 10, 2019","Some parts of the course were informative.  Some were disappointing.  Replaying it in my mind now that I'm done, I feel that the course dwelt on the flaws of financial markets, rather than being an explanation of their workings.  It was an indictment of markets more than I would have expected, instead of being instructive toward them.  There was a section toward the end on ""critics of finance"".  Far less effort was made in defense of modern finance (a wonderful field).",3

"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Julian L G,"Jan 4, 2019","It is amazing how bad this is considering that it is marketed as an IBM product. This is not the level of quality people expect when they hear the name IBM! You'd be better off paying 9.99 for a Udemy course than taking this course. It is not in depth at all and does a stunningly poor job at building real understanding and competency. The videos and labs are full of sloppiness and errors... again, not living up to the IBM name.

"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Aykut Ö,"Mar 4, 2019","  As in the other parts of the certificate, the tasks are simply too easy. The content in the videos (many typos!!!!) are really valuable but the tasks man... Only the surface of the surface will be discussed, no deeping down into the wild. In this course the libraries numpy and pandas are presented but in the final assignment we actually don't needed the libs... When I read the description of the final assignment, I was excited because I assumed we will need to code EVERYTHING ourselves. So really do the thinking of how to solve the requirements, testing it in a notebook out, reading the docs, discovering new cool stuff... But unfortunately my dream did not come true. The most exciting function was already provided and some of the answers were little bit of copy and paste instead of really recalling newly learned knowledge. Before this review I really wanted to give 4 out of 5 stars but after writing this review I will now give only 2 stars. Actually, 2 stars are in my opinion unfair, since the creators have put a lot of time and love in the course content. Unfortunately, so much potential is thrown away  ",2

I spend many hours on a number of evenings figuring what was meant. If this lead to constructive learning, I'd be OK with it. But now it was just a long egg-hunt to figure out how I was to post something using idiosyncratic IBM infrastructure which taught me little about Python. Was this course even test driven?",1

Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Basil K,"May 18, 2022","There is so much information missing in the labs in this course esp starting from Week 3. The videos it seems like were put together in a hurry with crucial information missing and labs are even worse than the videos. They are expecting one to find, set, unset files in extremely long scripts without providing any information on how it is done. Furthermore, there is little to no information given on why certain commands are called what they are called making this course not at all intuitive. I wish someone else has reviewed this course before putting it online. Such a wasted opportunity to educate people. ",1

I feel like I learned almost nothing!",1
Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Mateusz K,"Jan 24, 2024","Everything that follows, is just my own personal opinion, if not stated otherwise. It is based on my observations and interactions with teaching staff in the course discussion forums (for the last few months).
This is a very poorly executed course.
As of today (23 Jan 2024) this course for me still does not meet the criteria of a ""good resource for learning"" the basics of Linux CLI and shell scripting (despite few minor improvements already applied).
Some of the topics are hastily skimmed through in the videos, and almost no mechanism presented in the course is thoroughly explained.
Many of the ""basic concepts"" for Bash (and other modern shells) like e.g. function definitions, proper error handling, etc., are not even included in the course.
The importance of using correct quotations for variable/parameter expansions is also never mentioned nor explained, although it should be considered essential ""best practice"".
Peer-graded Final Assignment instructions/""guide"" contains some errors and not fully tested solutions, advertised as ""working correctly"".
The similar can be said about grading rubrics for the final assignment - which additionally are not focused on the actual results of the code execution, but instead they're focused on the code ""looks"", as in its visual resemblance (being as close to ""identical"" as possible) to what the course's staff have written in the grading rubrics.
In some cases, if the teaching staff finds a question in a discussion forum a bit more ""inconvenient"" for them to answer (or they're not fully capable of providing the correct answer to it in a timely manner?), then they would rather:
a) ignore the question completely (the least they can do is to not get involved at all) or reply with something similar to: ""we'll investigate the issue and get back to you"" (the latter ""get back to you"" almost never happens for a ""more complicated"" question);
b) reply with some irrelevant, impractical, incorrect, or otherwise unuseful information;
c) politely ask, to not bring the subject up ever again, as it may ""overwhelm the learners"";
d) delete the post (most often containing a valid, correct answer to the question) from discussion forums (I see censorship as ""means of hiding incompetence""?)
e) repeat other learner's correct answer (sometimes only slightly modifying it);
f) use and completely rely on AI LLM (e.g. ChatGPT, Bard, or other) and answers provided by it (which are mostly ridiculous), without even basic output verification; 
g) and also (occasionally) delete any relevant corrections (made by more knowledgeable learners) to previous staff's posts/replies;
than admit to any mistakes in the course contents, admit to lack of expertise in the subject matter, and address the questions properly - e.g. by allowing open discussion on potential improvements to the course materials, and implementing all said improvements as soon as possible (after reviewing).
These practices have been reported, and as I was assured by the Coursera Support Team, this kind of inappropriate teaching staff's behaviors will be escalated further, so I'm awaiting next developments of the situation.
But I still think this kind of inappropriate behaviors are a clear example, of what gives (or rather should give) the Skill-Up Technologies Pvt. Ltd. / SkillUp Online (employers for the most of ""teaching staff"") a bad reputation.
This also might give Coursera courses and IBM Skills Network a really bad publicity in a long-run.
Teaching and following ""best practices"", and answering doubts with relevant, thorough, technical knowledge in the discussion forums of this course... is something you unlikely/rarely find coming from the teaching staff.
Generally, teaching staff don't seem to be fit for the job of thoroughly explaining the course materials and teaching the proper ""understanding"" of your mistakes (as hard as they try to be seen ""cooperative""),
but as I see it, they're better suited for
a) only requesting you to ""copy and paste"" their code samples, that they believe should work best as a ""correct solution"" in their opinions (side note, again, ""my opinion"" - their code doesn't work all that great, and is not written with all the ""best practices"" in mind) and 
b) deleting ""inconvenient"" posts from the discussion forums whenever they please.
To sum it up: in its current form, and with its current teaching staff replying in the discussion forums, I'd definitely not recommend this course to anyone, especially beginners. And I'd discourage seeking any ""great"" learning experience from Skill-Up Technologies Pvt. Ltd. / SkillUp Online - thus I'd strongly suggest searching for some other, better resources on the subjects regarding basics of working with Linux CLI and shell scripting.

Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Volkert d V,"Jan 19, 2024","I have a few qualms on this still good, dense course: (1) - there is a lot of jargon that is taken for granted. For someone new to programming - you can easily get lost - especially when certain programs are only mentioned once and then taken to be known (e.g. Kubernetes, RedHat etc.) A cheat sheet would be very welcome. (2) the videos, while clear, are very dense, and the voice is very mono-tone which became quite a turn-down. To make sure students capture it it would be helpful to have more cross-checking questions during the lecture. (3) the final peer reviewed exercise is tricky and the peer review system doesn't work that great. with all the talk on automated checking in IBMs DevOps course I would think an automated check would be more effective - and could actually point out to you what you did wrong. for example - I had trouble figuring out a certain line of code and I actually asked chatGPT - turns out I had one space too much. in another case I came up with a slightly different code which did the same job.

Introductory Human Physiology,By Maxine P M,"Jun 28, 2020","The primary reason for enrolling in the course was to enhance my knowledge base of human physiology. Although it has been many decades since I've taken anatomy and physiology as well as pathophysiology, I have taught it twice at the secondary level.  Upon reviewing the description of the course, it indicated that it was introductory, but knowledge of biology/science would be helpful, I thought it might be a great refresher course.  I beg to differ! This course WAS NOT introductory.  Let me give you the positives first: pdf's and readings were extremely helpful.  The negatives, the instructors were not impressive. One instructor talked absolutely too fast and much too often wouldn't complete the sentences OR she would repeat words or phrases that didn't make sense. I found it difficult to grasp the lecture when this instructor couldn't get through a sentence without stumbling over her thoughts, mumbling, trailing off and not finishing her sentence, etc. More often than not, the information provided in the lecture was inconsistent with the notes/pdf's. One other thing, she constantly smacked her mouth which was nerve-wrecking!  During the lectures, she would write on the powerpoints, which was either sloppy or not legible. After the fifth week, I honestly wanted to withdraw from the course, but decided to finish it out solely because it was half way completed and the time that had already been invested.  Many viewers gave the course 5 stars, I could not.  Although I completed the course with a 93.4% grade, the level of information was extensive, to some degree over the top.  The course needs to be restructured so that it stays within the context of an introductory course.  In my opinion, this course is more suitable for a first-second year medical student.  BTW, this is the sixth course that I have completed through Coursera, including a specialization.  Good luck!",2

Introductory Human Physiology,By Sylvia Q,"Jan 18, 2020","Great class - very dense, like drinking from a fire hose, but wow I learned a lot! I took this just because I wanted to learn more about how the body magically does what it does, every day, without me thinking about it. I had no prior experience in physiology or anatomy, so this required me to do a LOT of note-taking and a little bit of Googling on the side for further understanding. If a week's videos totaled 2 hours, I spent about 4-5 getting through them and taking notes. I should add that I did not use the forums regularly, but I saw that many students had, and that their questions were answered fairly promptly, often by Emma Jakoi herself. The end-of-unit quizzes always included questions which forced you to apply your new learning to cases, and these could be challenging! Thanks to Duke for making this great class available online for free.",5

Introductory Human Physiology,By Joshua S,"Dec 9, 2019"," It is so hard to learn from a professor who can't get through 2  sentences without stumbling over her thoughts, mumbling, trailing off  and not finishing her sentence, etc. Perhaps if she spent less time  pretending to be John Madden with her little board, she could focus on  being an effective orator. Perhaps the second professor would have been better, but after 2 hours of listening to Dr. Jakoi, I now have to contact Coursera to see if I can get a refund or switch courses.",1
Introductory Human Physiology,By Anastasiia N,"Oct 24, 2015","The effect of this course in understanding the body physiology and understanding the terminology of other courses can be compared to learning to read. Now I can take other, more specialized courses without having to Google every other word and actually understand the processes they're talking about instead of simply memorizing them. ",5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Dustin J,"Aug 23, 2020","I'm a college freshman (majoring in nursing) and I took this course due to the pandemic. I found this course challenging since it focuses more on the physiology of the human body in more detail than a regular my anatomy and physiology class back in high school. This course isn't really an ""introductory"" course, you may need some background on science courses like chemistry, biology, anatomy, and physiology (So keep that in mind if you want to enroll). I have a limited background in science these courses (Biology, chemistry, etc) and finished this course, and yes it is possible to finish this course without knowing all about science stuff, it just took a little more effort to quickly learn science terms and stuff. With all of that, the course was great and for a nursing major like me really helped me developed surface-level knowledge about the function of the human body. Lectures are good, a little fast for me but they provide great PDF that I can refer to. Practice quizzes did help me a lot, but I hope that they provide feedback or explanation on why I got it wrong instead of just showing ""correct"" or ""incorrect"". It's worth my time learning physiology and I highly recommend it! Big thanks to the instructors and staff, especially Coursera for making this course free to the public!",5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Karen J,"May 10, 2020","Definitely, this is not an introductory course. Actually, you need some prior background in physiology, biology, chemistry, anatomy before taking it. It is also very challenging!  ",5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Ariane M,"Nov 4, 2017",Very very interesting but also very challenging. I would not say this is a beginner's physiology course. Very much worth doing if you are interested in the medical field of some sort. ,4
Introductory Human Physiology,By Lucie P,"Jul 26, 2016","This course seems to require a high level of foundation knowledge that I don't have.

It helps me to gain better knowledge and information to what happens to our body in response to all those external influences of stress, intake of food and liquid.  All the lectures are very professionally conducted with clear notes in the resources.  Many times, video lectures provided very good external cases beyond the texts.  I must also respect that both of you continue with the lectures despite hearing coughing many times throughout.  Great professionalism demonstrated, even in such coursera.co course.",5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Christine A,"Apr 20, 2020","This course is excellent, if physiology is something you need for your career/personal interest. Mimi Jakoi and  Jennifer Carbrey are magnificent in their field, and they both provide their tremendous insight to a high-functioning foundation level for the subject. However, if you are someone like me, a middle school science teacher who was only looking to find a novice level of physiology, you are going to get above and beyond what you imagined. I would definitely recommend this course to those who are highly invested in the subject, as it provides a great breadth of detail to 10 human systems. ",5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Parvathy s n,"May 28, 2022",it was a fun ride to be a part of this journey of learning  HUMAN PHYSIOLOGY .....it was very much helpful for understanding the basic concepts of our body how our body functions internally as well their hormonal capabilities. i feel really confident now because the lecture was easy to understand i thoroughly enjoyed. thank you. ,5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Pei-Hsuan L,"Jun 12, 2020","I don't speak for everyone, but this course was relatively difficult for an introductory course. It required an adequate amount of base/foundation on the subject in order for one to understand what the lesson is talking about. ",3

Thank you for all for all of the hard work required to create such a comprehensive course,5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Calista L,"Oct 8, 2020","Great things first: It’s a great course, with quite an
amount of information each video each module. For each week’s two to three
video hours, I spent 5 to 6 hours researching through googling or textbook
reading, and an intense note-taking all along. I highly recommend anyone who
wants a ‘warm-up’ in college physiology to do this course. This is perhaps a
first college level physiology, but it’s no way ‘introductory’. For a student with
mostly humanities background like me, it’s going to be a challenging course.
But it is really worth doing.",5

First Step Korean,By Mailine Y,"Oct 25, 2019","This class was very hard to follow. Pronunciation is key to any language. This course does not help you become even close to basic proficiency because there is no pronunciation key available. The worksheets are so hard to follow because it's all in Hangul with no pronunciation key or english pronunciation available. For a beginner course, this should have been standard- we don't know how to read Hangul and it shouldn't be expected during a beginners course. This course has a lot of room for improvement and would be great once they are implemented to become more user friendly. Also, rather than just using Hangul and English words in the videos, there should be pronunciation underneath the Hangul to make sure students are really getting the words correct instead of them trying to figure out word it is and referring to worksheets all the time. I did not have a good time learning the language because it was so frustrating trying to figure out what she was saying exactly- thus making the quizzes even more difficult!!",2
First Step Korean,By Lynne,"Dec 16, 2016",It was very well organised and presented. There was good opportunity for repetition in the videos and good opportunity to study the main written expressions and grammar in the PDF files. Excellent!,5

First Step Korean,By LeapingFrog E,"Nov 17, 2016","Although the instructor was good at presenting the information, I felt that the reference sheets should of had the phonetic pronunciations next to the Korean writing.

I did still learn a great deal of vocabulary.",3

First Step Korean,By jenn (,"Nov 30, 2018","This is the first online course where I can begin to understand how to put sentence structure together and begin to understand honorifics. I do think that you have to come into this course with an understanding of the Korean alphabet and basic knowledge of how to compose and read letters. Once you have that down, this course definitely helps you begin to move forward in becoming fluent with verbal and written comprehension. You definitely have to practice and repeat your practice consistently to retain your new knowledge. I love this course. Thank you!",5
First Step Korean,By Büşra G,"Oct 17, 2017",I wish there was korean subtitles instead of [FOREIGN] .,3
First Step Korean,By Kathy C,"Feb 15, 2017","This was a good course, but much more ambitious than the description or name suggests.  I had to watch the videos at 75% speed in order to figure out what was actually said, as I have never heard any Korean before.  I used the quizlet flashcards and some youtube videos in order to learn the material, as the ""lecture notes"" were not always very helpful.  So in all, a good course if you can access some supplementary activities.  In fact, adding the quizlet flashcards to the lesson either before the lecture or before the quiz would be helpful for future students.  I plan to take the class again in order to master the material.",3

Financial Markets,By Deleted A,"Apr 23, 2019","This course is virtually worthless. I couldn't follow the lectures, and I have a PhD and have been a tenured professor for almost two decades. The online course is based on snippets taken from face-to-face lectures and breakout sessions, and the result is utter incoherence. The instructor frequently refers to concepts that have not yet been encountered in the online version of the course; makes extensive use of mathematical notations and formulas whose variables are never properly explained; and generally does a poor job of explaining the material. This online version of the Yale course was obviously slapped together with very little thought and production value; it's one of those unsuccessful attempts to bring in revenue on the cheap, creating an online version out of existing face-to-face material, rather than building a real online course from scratch. This was wasted money and time. This attempt to capitalize on the Yale brand is pathetic.    ",1

The strongest point of this course is the simplicity with which it conveys the importance and relevance of finance in today's world. The instructor and his team have taken great care to introduce topics in a manner simple enough for anyone to understand. While the course content may not go very in-depth into how a particular stock market works, or how particular stocks move, it provides great insight into why the stock market is necessary and relevant in our current society and how human behavior and its expression through policy and law can result in both financial progress and also crisis.

I have gained the basic knowledge of financial markets and their applications in reality. Absolutely right, finance is not just about making money that I thought before joining in this course, and as a popular opinion as well, it is more than that, it has much more meaningful. This course has brought to me the necessary skills to make more rational decisions in my life, in my future career, I think. It’s also helped me to realize how I should work in this sector to serve the right purposes, to make the people living around me to be better. And it’s true that educational finance is very important to everyone. Professor Robert Shiller is an amazing teacher, many thanks to Professor Robert Shiller and Yale’s Financial Markets Course team. I highly recommend taking this course! ",5

Now I have foundational understanding of finance upon which I can build my knowledge and also my ability to make informed application.",5
Financial Markets,By Anthony S,"Jan 10, 2019","Some parts of the course were informative.  Some were disappointing.  Replaying it in my mind now that I'm done, I feel that the course dwelt on the flaws of financial markets, rather than being an explanation of their workings.  It was an indictment of markets more than I would have expected, instead of being instructive toward them.  There was a section toward the end on ""critics of finance"".  Far less effort was made in defense of modern finance (a wonderful field).",3

The content in the videos (many typos!!!!) are really valuable but the tasks man... Only the surface of the surface will be discussed, no deeping down into the wild. In this course the libraries numpy and pandas are presented but in the final assignment we actually don't needed the libs... When I read the description of the final assignment, I was excited because I assumed we will need to code EVERYTHING ourselves. So really do the thinking of how to solve the requirements, testing it in a notebook out, reading the docs, discovering new cool stuff... But unfortunately my dream did not come true. The most exciting function was already provided and some of the answers were little bit of copy and paste instead of really recalling newly learned knowledge. Before this review I really wanted to give 4 out of 5 stars but after writing this review I will now give only 2 stars. Actually, 2 stars are in my opinion unfair, since the creators have put a lot of time and love in the course content. Unfortunately, so much potential is thrown away  ",2

Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Basil K,"May 18, 2022","There is so much information missing in the labs in this course esp starting from Week 3. The videos it seems like were put together in a hurry with crucial information missing and labs are even worse than the videos. They are expecting one to find, set, unset files in extremely long scripts without providing any information on how it is done. Furthermore, there is little to no information given on why certain commands are called what they are called making this course not at all intuitive. I wish someone else has reviewed this course before putting it online. Such a wasted opportunity to educate people. ",1
Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Tyler M,"Jan 18, 2022","This need a lot more hands-on experience and explaining the *why* of commands. The course never explained any logic behind operators and commands, so it was never clear how everything worked.",3

Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Amanda W,"Aug 2, 2022","This course is terrible for beginners!!

I feel like I learned almost nothing!",1
Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Mateusz K,"Jan 24, 2024","Everything that follows, is just my own personal opinion, if not stated otherwise. It is based on my observations and interactions with teaching staff in the course discussion forums (for the last few months).
This is a very poorly executed course.
As of today (23 Jan 2024) this course for me still does not meet the criteria of a ""good resource for learning"" the basics of Linux CLI and shell scripting (despite few minor improvements already applied).
Some of the topics are hastily skimmed through in the videos, and almost no mechanism presented in the course is thoroughly explained.
Many of the ""basic concepts"" for Bash (and other modern shells) like e.g. function definitions, proper error handling, etc., are not even included in the course.
The importance of using correct quotations for variable/parameter expansions is also never mentioned nor explained, although it should be considered essential ""best practice"".
Peer-graded Final Assignment instructions/""guide"" contains some errors and not fully tested solutions, advertised as ""working correctly"".
The similar can be said about grading rubrics for the final assignment - which additionally are not focused on the actual results of the code execution, but instead they're focused on the code ""looks"", as in its visual resemblance (being as close to ""identical"" as possible) to what the course's staff have written in the grading rubrics.
In some cases, if the teaching staff finds a question in a discussion forum a bit more ""inconvenient"" for them to answer (or they're not fully capable of providing the correct answer to it in a timely manner?), then they would rather:
a) ignore the question completely (the least they can do is to not get involved at all) or reply with something similar to: ""we'll investigate the issue and get back to you"" (the latter ""get back to you"" almost never happens for a ""more complicated"" question);
b) reply with some irrelevant, impractical, incorrect, or otherwise unuseful information;
c) politely ask, to not bring the subject up ever again, as it may ""overwhelm the learners"";
d) delete the post (most often containing a valid, correct answer to the question) from discussion forums (I see censorship as ""means of hiding incompetence""?)
e) repeat other learner's correct answer (sometimes only slightly modifying it);
f) use and completely rely on AI LLM (e.g. ChatGPT, Bard, or other) and answers provided by it (which are mostly ridiculous), without even basic output verification; 
g) and also (occasionally) delete any relevant corrections (made by more knowledgeable learners) to previous staff's posts/replies;
than admit to any mistakes in the course contents, admit to lack of expertise in the subject matter, and address the questions properly - e.g. by allowing open discussion on potential improvements to the course materials, and implementing all said improvements as soon as possible (after reviewing).
These practices have been reported, and as I was assured by the Coursera Support Team, this kind of inappropriate teaching staff's behaviors will be escalated further, so I'm awaiting next developments of the situation.
But I still think this kind of inappropriate behaviors are a clear example, of what gives (or rather should give) the Skill-Up Technologies Pvt. Ltd. / SkillUp Online (employers for the most of ""teaching staff"") a bad reputation.
This also might give Coursera courses and IBM Skills Network a really bad publicity in a long-run.
Teaching and following ""best practices"", and answering doubts with relevant, thorough, technical knowledge in the discussion forums of this course... is something you unlikely/rarely find coming from the teaching staff.
Generally, teaching staff don't seem to be fit for the job of thoroughly explaining the course materials and teaching the proper ""understanding"" of your mistakes (as hard as they try to be seen ""cooperative""),
but as I see it, they're better suited for
a) only requesting you to ""copy and paste"" their code samples, that they believe should work best as a ""correct solution"" in their opinions (side note, again, ""my opinion"" - their code doesn't work all that great, and is not written with all the ""best practices"" in mind) and 
b) deleting ""inconvenient"" posts from the discussion forums whenever they please.
To sum it up: in its current form, and with its current teaching staff replying in the discussion forums, I'd definitely not recommend this course to anyone, especially beginners. And I'd discourage seeking any ""great"" learning experience from Skill-Up Technologies Pvt. Ltd. / SkillUp Online - thus I'd strongly suggest searching for some other, better resources on the subjects regarding basics of working with Linux CLI and shell scripting.

Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Volkert d V,"Jan 19, 2024","I have a few qualms on this still good, dense course: (1) - there is a lot of jargon that is taken for granted. For someone new to programming - you can easily get lost - especially when certain programs are only mentioned once and then taken to be known (e.g. Kubernetes, RedHat etc.) A cheat sheet would be very welcome. (2) the videos, while clear, are very dense, and the voice is very mono-tone which became quite a turn-down. To make sure students capture it it would be helpful to have more cross-checking questions during the lecture. (3) the final peer reviewed exercise is tricky and the peer review system doesn't work that great. with all the talk on automated checking in IBMs DevOps course I would think an automated check would be more effective - and could actually point out to you what you did wrong. for example - I had trouble figuring out a certain line of code and I actually asked chatGPT - turns out I had one space too much. in another case I came up with a slightly different code which did the same job.

Introductory Human Physiology,By Maxine P M,"Jun 28, 2020","The primary reason for enrolling in the course was to enhance my knowledge base of human physiology. Although it has been many decades since I've taken anatomy and physiology as well as pathophysiology, I have taught it twice at the secondary level.  Upon reviewing the description of the course, it indicated that it was introductory, but knowledge of biology/science would be helpful, I thought it might be a great refresher course.  I beg to differ! This course WAS NOT introductory.  Let me give you the positives first: pdf's and readings were extremely helpful.  The negatives, the instructors were not impressive. One instructor talked absolutely too fast and much too often wouldn't complete the sentences OR she would repeat words or phrases that didn't make sense. I found it difficult to grasp the lecture when this instructor couldn't get through a sentence without stumbling over her thoughts, mumbling, trailing off and not finishing her sentence, etc. More often than not, the information provided in the lecture was inconsistent with the notes/pdf's. One other thing, she constantly smacked her mouth which was nerve-wrecking!  During the lectures, she would write on the powerpoints, which was either sloppy or not legible. After the fifth week, I honestly wanted to withdraw from the course, but decided to finish it out solely because it was half way completed and the time that had already been invested.  Many viewers gave the course 5 stars, I could not.  Although I completed the course with a 93.4% grade, the level of information was extensive, to some degree over the top.  The course needs to be restructured so that it stays within the context of an introductory course.  In my opinion, this course is more suitable for a first-second year medical student.  BTW, this is the sixth course that I have completed through Coursera, including a specialization.  Good luck!",2

I took this just because I wanted to learn more about how the body magically does what it does, every day, without me thinking about it. I had no prior experience in physiology or anatomy, so this required me to do a LOT of note-taking and a little bit of Googling on the side for further understanding. If a week's videos totaled 2 hours, I spent about 4-5 getting through them and taking notes. I should add that I did not use the forums regularly, but I saw that many students had, and that their questions were answered fairly promptly, often by Emma Jakoi herself. The end-of-unit quizzes always included questions which forced you to apply your new learning to cases, and these could be challenging! Thanks to Duke for making this great class available online for free.",5

Introductory Human Physiology,By Joshua S,"Dec 9, 2019"," It is so hard to learn from a professor who can't get through 2  sentences without stumbling over her thoughts, mumbling, trailing off  and not finishing her sentence, etc. Perhaps if she spent less time  pretending to be John Madden with her little board, she could focus on  being an effective orator. Perhaps the second professor would have been better, but after 2 hours of listening to Dr. Jakoi, I now have to contact Coursera to see if I can get a refund or switch courses.",1

Introductory Human Physiology,By Dustin J,"Aug 23, 2020","I'm a college freshman (majoring in nursing) and I took this course due to the pandemic. I found this course challenging since it focuses more on the physiology of the human body in more detail than a regular my anatomy and physiology class back in high school. This course isn't really an ""introductory"" course, you may need some background on science courses like chemistry, biology, anatomy, and physiology (So keep that in mind if you want to enroll). I have a limited background in science these courses (Biology, chemistry, etc) and finished this course, and yes it is possible to finish this course without knowing all about science stuff, it just took a little more effort to quickly learn science terms and stuff. With all of that, the course was great and for a nursing major like me really helped me developed surface-level knowledge about the function of the human body. Lectures are good, a little fast for me but they provide great PDF that I can refer to. Practice quizzes did help me a lot, but I hope that they provide feedback or explanation on why I got it wrong instead of just showing ""correct"" or ""incorrect"". It's worth my time learning physiology and I highly recommend it! Big thanks to the instructors and staff, especially Coursera for making this course free to the public!",5

However, if you are someone like me, a middle school science teacher who was only looking to find a novice level of physiology, you are going to get above and beyond what you imagined.

reading, and an intense note-taking all along. I highly recommend anyone who
wants a ‘warm-up’ in college physiology to do this course. This is perhaps a
first college level physiology, but it’s no way ‘introductory’. For a student with

First Step Korean,By Mailine Y,"Oct 25, 2019","This class was very hard to follow. Pronunciation is key to any language. This course does not help you become even close to basic proficiency because there is no pronunciation key available. The worksheets are so hard to follow because it's all in Hangul with no pronunciation key or english pronunciation available. For a beginner course, this should have been standard- we don't know how to read Hangul and it shouldn't be expected during a beginners course. This course has a lot of room for improvement and would be great once they are implemented to become more user friendly. Also, rather than just using Hangul and English words in the videos, there should be pronunciation underneath the Hangul to make sure students are really getting the words correct instead of them trying to figure out word it is and referring to worksheets all the time. I did not have a good time learning the language because it was so frustrating trying to figure out what she was saying exactly- thus making the quizzes even more difficult!!",2
First Step Korean,By Lynne,"Dec 16, 2016",It was very well organised and presented. There was good opportunity for repetition in the videos and good opportunity to study the main written expressions and grammar in the PDF files. Excellent!,5

I do think that you have to come into this course with an understanding of the Korean alphabet and basic knowledge of how to compose and read letters. Once you have that down, this course definitely helps you begin to move forward in becoming fluent with verbal and written comprehension. You definitely have to practice and repeat your practice consistently to retain your new knowledge. I love this course. Thank you!",5

First Step Korean,By Kathy C,"Feb 15, 2017","This was a good course, but much more ambitious than the description or name suggests.  I had to watch the videos at 75% speed in order to figure out what was actually said, as I have never heard any Korean before.  I used the quizlet flashcards and some youtube videos in order to learn the material, as the ""lecture notes"" were not always very helpful.  So in all, a good course if you can access some supplementary activities.  In fact, adding the quizlet flashcards to the lesson either before the lecture or before the quiz would be helpful for future students.  I plan to take the class again in order to master the material.",3

Financial Markets,By Deleted A,"Apr 23, 2019","This course is virtually worthless. I couldn't follow the lectures, and I have a PhD and have been a tenured professor for almost two decades. The online course is based on snippets taken from face-to-face lectures and breakout sessions, and the result is utter incoherence. The instructor frequently refers to concepts that have not yet been encountered in the online version of the course; makes extensive use of mathematical notations and formulas whose variables are never properly explained; and generally does a poor job of explaining the material. This online version of the Yale course was obviously slapped together with very little thought and production value; it's one of those unsuccessful attempts to bring in revenue on the cheap, creating an online version out of existing face-to-face material, rather than building a real online course from scratch. This was wasted money and time. This attempt to capitalize on the Yale brand is pathetic.    ",1

Financial Markets,By Tiyash B,"May 3, 2018","A great introductory level course which is recommended for anyone with a remote interest in finance irrespective of whether they have a background in finance or economics. The strongest point of this course is the simplicity with which it conveys the importance and relevance of finance in today's world. The instructor and his team have taken great care to introduce topics in a manner simple enough for anyone to understand. While the course content may not go very in-depth into how a particular stock market works, or how particular stocks move, it provides great insight into why the stock market is necessary and relevant in our current society and how human behavior and its expression through policy and law can result in both financial progress and also crisis.

Financial Markets,By Doan T L ,"May 26, 2019","It’s a good online course in Finance that I have never learned before. I have gained the basic knowledge of financial markets and their applications in reality. Absolutely right, finance is not just about making money that I thought before joining in this course, and as a popular opinion as well, it is more than that, it has much more meaningful. This course has brought to me the necessary skills to make more rational decisions in my life, in my future career, I think. It’s also helped me to realize how I should work in this sector to serve the right purposes, to make the people living around me to be better. And it’s true that educational finance is very important to everyone. Professor Robert Shiller is an amazing teacher, many thanks to Professor Robert Shiller and Yale’s Financial Markets Course team. I highly recommend taking this course! ",5
Financial Markets,By Stefano E,"Mar 17, 2019","Probably the best financial market course on coursera. Intense and very rich in content. Too much,  though.

I had to review most of the videos a second time.",3
Financial Markets,By Emmanuel I,"Mar 15, 2019","I enjoyed the course thoroughly, it was a little difficult at first because my background isn't in finance.

Now I have foundational understanding of finance upon which I can build my knowledge and also my ability to make informed application.",5
Financial Markets,By Anthony S,"Jan 10, 2019","Some parts of the course were informative.  Some were disappointing.  Replaying it in my mind now that I'm done, I feel that the course dwelt on the flaws of financial markets, rather than being an explanation of their workings.  It was an indictment of markets more than I would have expected, instead of being instructive toward them.  There was a section toward the end on ""critics of finance"".  Far less effort was made in defense of modern finance (a wonderful field).",3
Financial Markets,By Maumau B,"Jun 30, 2019","You can never get bored with Professor Shiller.

Business Analysis & Process Management,By Thomas G,"Dec 15, 2020","""Pause and look at this doc ok welcome back now pause and do it yourself ok you now know how to write a business plan"". The instructor simply read a script verbatim with no punctuation, pauses, or personality. The whole thing was incredibly rushed, and ""rushed"" is not the same thing as ""fast paced"". Absolutely no justification for using the clunky Rhyme virtual desktop, as all you do is open a Google Doc and make a Lucid Chart account.

So really do the thinking of how to solve the requirements, testing it in a notebook out, reading the docs, discovering new cool stuff... But unfortunately my dream did not come true. The most exciting function was already provided and some of the answers were little bit of copy and paste instead of really recalling newly learned knowledge. Before this review I really wanted to give 4 out of 5 stars but after writing this review I will now give only 2 stars.

Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Basil K,"May 18, 2022","There is so much information missing in the labs in this course esp starting from Week 3. The videos it seems like were put together in a hurry with crucial information missing and labs are even worse than the videos. They are expecting one to find, set, unset files in extremely long scripts without providing any information on how it is done. Furthermore, there is little to no information given on why certain commands are called what they are called making this course not at all intuitive. I wish someone else has reviewed this course before putting it online. Such a wasted opportunity to educate people. ",1
Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Tyler M,"Jan 18, 2022","This need a lot more hands-on experience and explaining the *why* of commands. The course never explained any logic behind operators and commands, so it was never clear how everything worked.",3

I feel like I learned almost nothing!",1
Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Mateusz K,"Jan 24, 2024","Everything that follows, is just my own personal opinion, if not stated otherwise. It is based on my observations and interactions with teaching staff in the course discussion forums (for the last few months).
This is a very poorly executed course.
As of today (23 Jan 2024) this course for me still does not meet the criteria of a ""good resource for learning"" the basics of Linux CLI and shell scripting (despite few minor improvements already applied).
Some of the topics are hastily skimmed through in the videos, and almost no mechanism presented in the course is thoroughly explained.
Many of the ""basic concepts"" for Bash (and other modern shells) like e.g. function definitions, proper error handling, etc., are not even included in the course.
The importance of using correct quotations for variable/parameter expansions is also never mentioned nor explained, although it should be considered essential ""best practice"".
Peer-graded Final Assignment instructions/""guide"" contains some errors and not fully tested solutions, advertised as ""working correctly"".
The similar can be said about grading rubrics for the final assignment - which additionally are not focused on the actual results of the code execution, but instead they're focused on the code ""looks"", as in its visual resemblance (being as close to ""identical"" as possible) to what the course's staff have written in the grading rubrics.
In some cases, if the teaching staff finds a question in a discussion forum a bit more ""inconvenient"" for them to answer (or they're not fully capable of providing the correct answer to it in a timely manner?), then they would rather:
a) ignore the question completely (the least they can do is to not get involved at all) or reply with something similar to: ""we'll investigate the issue and get back to you"" (the latter ""get back to you"" almost never happens for a ""more complicated"" question);
b) reply with some irrelevant, impractical, incorrect, or otherwise unuseful information;
c) politely ask, to not bring the subject up ever again, as it may ""overwhelm the learners"";
d) delete the post (most often containing a valid, correct answer to the question) from discussion forums (I see censorship as ""means of hiding incompetence""?)
e) repeat other learner's correct answer (sometimes only slightly modifying it);
f) use and completely rely on AI LLM (e.g. ChatGPT, Bard, or other) and answers provided by it (which are mostly ridiculous), without even basic output verification; 
g) and also (occasionally) delete any relevant corrections (made by more knowledgeable learners) to previous staff's posts/replies;
than admit to any mistakes in the course contents, admit to lack of expertise in the subject matter, and address the questions properly - e.g. by allowing open discussion on potential improvements to the course materials, and implementing all said improvements as soon as possible (after reviewing).
These practices have been reported, and as I was assured by the Coursera Support Team, this kind of inappropriate teaching staff's behaviors will be escalated further, so I'm awaiting next developments of the situation.
But I still think this kind of inappropriate behaviors are a clear example, of what gives (or rather should give) the Skill-Up Technologies Pvt. Ltd. / SkillUp Online (employers for the most of ""teaching staff"") a bad reputation.
This also might give Coursera courses and IBM Skills Network a really bad publicity in a long-run.
Teaching and following ""best practices"", and answering doubts with relevant, thorough, technical knowledge in the discussion forums of this course... is something you unlikely/rarely find coming from the teaching staff.
Generally, teaching staff don't seem to be fit for the job of thoroughly explaining the course materials and teaching the proper ""understanding"" of your mistakes (as hard as they try to be seen ""cooperative""),
but as I see it, they're better suited for
a) only requesting you to ""copy and paste"" their code samples, that they believe should work best as a ""correct solution"" in their opinions (side note, again, ""my opinion"" - their code doesn't work all that great, and is not written with all the ""best practices"" in mind) and 
b) deleting ""inconvenient"" posts from the discussion forums whenever they please.
To sum it up: in its current form, and with its current teaching staff replying in the discussion forums, I'd definitely not recommend this course to anyone, especially beginners. And I'd discourage seeking any ""great"" learning experience from Skill-Up Technologies Pvt. Ltd. / SkillUp Online - thus I'd strongly suggest searching for some other, better resources on the subjects regarding basics of working with Linux CLI and shell scripting.

Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Volkert d V,"Jan 19, 2024","I have a few qualms on this still good, dense course: (1) - there is a lot of jargon that is taken for granted. For someone new to programming - you can easily get lost - especially when certain programs are only mentioned once and then taken to be known (e.g. Kubernetes, RedHat etc.) A cheat sheet would be very welcome. (2) the videos, while clear, are very dense, and the voice is very mono-tone which became quite a turn-down. To make sure students capture it it would be helpful to have more cross-checking questions during the lecture. (3) the final peer reviewed exercise is tricky and the peer review system doesn't work that great. with all the talk on automated checking in IBMs DevOps course I would think an automated check would be more effective - and could actually point out to you what you did wrong. for example - I had trouble figuring out a certain line of code and I actually asked chatGPT - turns out I had one space too much. in another case I came up with a slightly different code which did the same job.

Introductory Human Physiology,By Maxine P M,"Jun 28, 2020","The primary reason for enrolling in the course was to enhance my knowledge base of human physiology. Although it has been many decades since I've taken anatomy and physiology as well as pathophysiology, I have taught it twice at the secondary level.  Upon reviewing the description of the course, it indicated that it was introductory, but knowledge of biology/science would be helpful, I thought it might be a great refresher course.  I beg to differ! This course WAS NOT introductory.  Let me give you the positives first: pdf's and readings were extremely helpful.  The negatives, the instructors were not impressive. One instructor talked absolutely too fast and much too often wouldn't complete the sentences OR she would repeat words or phrases that didn't make sense. I found it difficult to grasp the lecture when this instructor couldn't get through a sentence without stumbling over her thoughts, mumbling, trailing off and not finishing her sentence, etc. More often than not, the information provided in the lecture was inconsistent with the notes/pdf's. One other thing, she constantly smacked her mouth which was nerve-wrecking!  During the lectures, she would write on the powerpoints, which was either sloppy or not legible. After the fifth week, I honestly wanted to withdraw from the course, but decided to finish it out solely because it was half way completed and the time that had already been invested.  Many viewers gave the course 5 stars, I could not.  Although I completed the course with a 93.4% grade, the level of information was extensive, to some degree over the top.  The course needs to be restructured so that it stays within the context of an introductory course.  In my opinion, this course is more suitable for a first-second year medical student.  BTW, this is the sixth course that I have completed through Coursera, including a specialization.  Good luck!",2

Introductory Human Physiology,By Sylvia Q,"Jan 18, 2020","Great class - very dense, like drinking from a fire hose, but wow I learned a lot! I took this just because I wanted to learn more about how the body magically does what it does, every day, without me thinking about it. I had no prior experience in physiology or anatomy, so this required me to do a LOT of note-taking and a little bit of Googling on the side for further understanding. If a week's videos totaled 2 hours, I spent about 4-5 getting through them and taking notes. I should add that I did not use the forums regularly, but I saw that many students had, and that their questions were answered fairly promptly, often by Emma Jakoi herself. The end-of-unit quizzes always included questions which forced you to apply your new learning to cases, and these could be challenging! Thanks to Duke for making this great class available online for free.",5

Perhaps the second professor would have been better, but after 2 hours of listening to Dr. Jakoi, I now have to contact Coursera to see if I can get a refund or switch courses.",1

Introductory Human Physiology,By Dustin J,"Aug 23, 2020","I'm a college freshman (majoring in nursing) and I took this course due to the pandemic. I found this course challenging since it focuses more on the physiology of the human body in more detail than a regular my anatomy and physiology class back in high school. This course isn't really an ""introductory"" course, you may need some background on science courses like chemistry, biology, anatomy, and physiology (So keep that in mind if you want to enroll). I have a limited background in science these courses (Biology, chemistry, etc) and finished this course, and yes it is possible to finish this course without knowing all about science stuff, it just took a little more effort to quickly learn science terms and stuff. With all of that, the course was great and for a nursing major like me really helped me developed surface-level knowledge about the function of the human body. Lectures are good, a little fast for me but they provide great PDF that I can refer to. Practice quizzes did help me a lot, but I hope that they provide feedback or explanation on why I got it wrong instead of just showing ""correct"" or ""incorrect"". It's worth my time learning physiology and I highly recommend it! Big thanks to the instructors and staff, especially Coursera for making this course free to the public!",5

Mimi Jakoi and  Jennifer Carbrey are magnificent in their field, and they both provide their tremendous insight to a high-functioning foundation level for the subject. However, if you are someone like me, a middle school science teacher who was only looking to find a novice level of physiology, you are going to get above and beyond what you imagined. I would definitely recommend this course to those who are highly invested in the subject, as it provides a great breadth of detail to 10 human systems. ",5

wants a ‘warm-up’ in college physiology to do this course. This is perhaps a

First Step Korean,By Mailine Y,"Oct 25, 2019","This class was very hard to follow. Pronunciation is key to any language. This course does not help you become even close to basic proficiency because there is no pronunciation key available. The worksheets are so hard to follow because it's all in Hangul with no pronunciation key or english pronunciation available. For a beginner course, this should have been standard- we don't know how to read Hangul and it shouldn't be expected during a beginners course. This course has a lot of room for improvement and would be great once they are implemented to become more user friendly. Also, rather than just using Hangul and English words in the videos, there should be pronunciation underneath the Hangul to make sure students are really getting the words correct instead of them trying to figure out word it is and referring to worksheets all the time. I did not have a good time learning the language because it was so frustrating trying to figure out what she was saying exactly- thus making the quizzes even more difficult!!",2

First Step Korean,By Just S,"Jan 9, 2019",The lecture and lessons were really nice but she speaks a bit too fast and you can't repeat what she said fast enough while learning it for the first time.,4
First Step Korean,By natalia m,"Dec 15, 2018","I love the course. The professor explained everything well. I understood everything. The practice exercises help you understand the lesson way better. The only thing that still gets me confused is the pronunciation on some vowels. But, there is a program included in the course that helps you with that. I totally recommend this course. 감사합니다 ! ",5
Financial Markets,By Deleted A,"Apr 23, 2019","This course is virtually worthless. I couldn't follow the lectures, and I have a PhD and have been a tenured professor for almost two decades. The online course is based on snippets taken from face-to-face lectures and breakout sessions, and the result is utter incoherence. The instructor frequently refers to concepts that have not yet been encountered in the online version of the course; makes extensive use of mathematical notations and formulas whose variables are never properly explained; and generally does a poor job of explaining the material. This online version of the Yale course was obviously slapped together with very little thought and production value; it's one of those unsuccessful attempts to bring in revenue on the cheap, creating an online version out of existing face-to-face material, rather than building a real online course from scratch. This was wasted money and time. This attempt to capitalize on the Yale brand is pathetic.    ",1
Financial Markets,By Sanam P,"Oct 23, 2017","This course was horrible! The Content was very disoriented and unclear. Videos were distorted, and jumping from one topic to another. There was no sense of continuity. One can not say this was a course from Yale...",1

Financial Markets,By Eli,"Sep 18, 2017",This course was aweful! I feel like I didnt learn anything useful. The information is very superficial. The math that is applied at some points is not well explained. The overall course lacks structure and substance. The quizes were just terrible. Please dont waste your time with this.,1

Financial Markets,By Alexander v D,"Aug 28, 2017",Great introductory course. Prof. Schiller's enthusiasm and style make it a pleasure to watch. Also the TA's and the group discussions interspersed in the course make it a very personable experience.,5
Financial Markets,By Tiyash B,"May 3, 2018","A great introductory level course which is recommended for anyone with a remote interest in finance irrespective of whether they have a background in finance or economics. The strongest point of this course is the simplicity with which it conveys the importance and relevance of finance in today's world. The instructor and his team have taken great care to introduce topics in a manner simple enough for anyone to understand. While the course content may not go very in-depth into how a particular stock market works, or how particular stocks move, it provides great insight into why the stock market is necessary and relevant in our current society and how human behavior and its expression through policy and law can result in both financial progress and also crisis. ",5
Financial Markets,By Erik M,"Nov 4, 2018",This was really a great experience. A course taught by a valued teach. Enjoyed it all the way though I would have liked more mathematical and theoretical models. But then where do you end in a MOOC ?,5
Financial Markets,By Doan T L ,"May 26, 2019","It’s a good online course in Finance that I have never learned before. I have gained the basic knowledge of financial markets and their applications in reality. Absolutely right, finance is not just about making money that I thought before joining in this course, and as a popular opinion as well, it is more than that, it has much more meaningful. This course has brought to me the necessary skills to make more rational decisions in my life, in my future career, I think. It’s also helped me to realize how I should work in this sector to serve the right purposes, to make the people living around me to be better. And it’s true that educational finance is very important to everyone. Professor Robert Shiller is an amazing teacher, many thanks to Professor Robert Shiller and Yale’s Financial Markets Course team. I highly recommend taking this course! ",5
Financial Markets,By Stefano E,"Mar 17, 2019","Probably the best financial market course on coursera. Intense and very rich in content. Too much,  though. Many topics would require more than a 10 minute video to be properly understood, and some lectures were difficult to follow. I'd probably reduce the content and focus on less topics but giving them more time.",3
Financial Markets,By Aniket G,"May 20, 2019","It was not very interesting. The course needs to be more self-explanatory, with real world examples, and not dull",1

Financial Markets,By James N,"Jun 7, 2019","From a knowledge perspective, I have learned a lot about financial markets, why various financial instruments exist, and the applications/implications of them. With all due respect to the lecturer, he was not very engaging and did not really provide emphasis on key concepts to make it stick. When explaining the concepts, he would ""dilute"" it with extra words or go off talking about ""relevant"" back story without wrapping it all up at the end. I had to review most of the videos a second time.",3
Financial Markets,By Emmanuel I,"Mar 15, 2019","I enjoyed the course thoroughly, it was a little difficult at first because my background isn't in finance. However, I pushed myself  to understand the concepts and principles such that I started to enjoy it. The lectures were really engaging. Now I have foundational understanding of finance upon which I can build my knowledge and also my ability to make informed application.",5
Financial Markets,By Anthony S,"Jan 10, 2019","Some parts of the course were informative.  Some were disappointing.  Replaying it in my mind now that I'm done, I feel that the course dwelt on the flaws of financial markets, rather than being an explanation of their workings.  It was an indictment of markets more than I would have expected, instead of being instructive toward them.  There was a section toward the end on ""critics of finance"".  Far less effort was made in defense of modern finance (a wonderful field).",3
Financial Markets,By Maumau B,"Jun 30, 2019","You can never get bored with Professor Shiller. He is very passionate about how things work or how to make it happen, and will convince you that everything in life needed finance. He likes history and is a lifelong learner. I rated 5 stars because he made it simple for people to learn regardless of ages or education. ",5
Business Analysis & Process Management,By Thomas G,"Dec 15, 2020","""Pause and look at this doc ok welcome back now pause and do it yourself ok you now know how to write a business plan"". The instructor simply read a script verbatim with no punctuation, pauses, or personality. The whole thing was incredibly rushed, and ""rushed"" is not the same thing as ""fast paced"". Absolutely no justification for using the clunky Rhyme virtual desktop, as all you do is open a Google Doc and make a Lucid Chart account. Why would I log into my email and set up another account in your virtual desktop?",1
Business Analysis & Process Management,By Gisela W,"Dec 19, 2020","I like the hands-on platform and the approach of following along with the instructor side by side. However, the instructor speaks way too fast. I lowered the speed to 0.7 and was still struggling to follow. Also, at times the questions/instructions are not 100% clear or confusing so that I wasn't sure what to do and just kept watching. The content is quite superficial. The project does give you some guidance in modeling a simple business process using Lucidchart which I appreciate.",2
Business Analysis & Process Management,By Deleted A,"Feb 11, 2021","Coursera please remove this course!

"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Julian L G,"Jan 4, 2019","It is amazing how bad this is considering that it is marketed as an IBM product. This is not the level of quality people expect when they hear the name IBM! You'd be better off paying 9.99 for a Udemy course than taking this course. It is not in depth at all and does a stunningly poor job at building real understanding and competency. The videos and labs are full of sloppiness and errors... again, not living up to the IBM name.

"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Aykut Ö,"Mar 4, 2019","  As in the other parts of the certificate, the tasks are simply too easy. The content in the videos (many typos!!!!) are really valuable but the tasks man... Only the surface of the surface will be discussed, no deeping down into the wild. In this course the libraries numpy and pandas are presented but in the final assignment we actually don't needed the libs... When I read the description of the final assignment, I was excited because I assumed we will need to code EVERYTHING ourselves. So really do the thinking of how to solve the requirements, testing it in a notebook out, reading the docs, discovering new cool stuff... But unfortunately my dream did not come true. The most exciting function was already provided and some of the answers were little bit of copy and paste instead of really recalling newly learned knowledge. Before this review I really wanted to give 4 out of 5 stars but after writing this review I will now give only 2 stars. Actually, 2 stars are in my opinion unfair, since the creators have put a lot of time and love in the course content. Unfortunately, so much potential is thrown away  ",2

Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Basil K,"May 18, 2022","There is so much information missing in the labs in this course esp starting from Week 3. The videos it seems like were put together in a hurry with crucial information missing and labs are even worse than the videos. They are expecting one to find, set, unset files in extremely long scripts without providing any information on how it is done. Furthermore, there is little to no information given on why certain commands are called what they are called making this course not at all intuitive. I wish someone else has reviewed this course before putting it online. Such a wasted opportunity to educate people. ",1
Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Tyler M,"Jan 18, 2022","This need a lot more hands-on experience and explaining the *why* of commands. The course never explained any logic behind operators and commands, so it was never clear how everything worked.",3

Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Amanda W,"Aug 2, 2022","This course is terrible for beginners!! None of the modules go in depth, it was difficult to understand because none of the commands are explained, and the final project is super advanced for what is actually taught in the class. I feel like I learned almost nothing!",1
Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Mateusz K,"Jan 24, 2024","Everything that follows, is just my own personal opinion, if not stated otherwise. It is based on my observations and interactions with teaching staff in the course discussion forums (for the last few months).
This is a very poorly executed course.
As of today (23 Jan 2024) this course for me still does not meet the criteria of a ""good resource for learning"" the basics of Linux CLI and shell scripting (despite few minor improvements already applied).
Some of the topics are hastily skimmed through in the videos, and almost no mechanism presented in the course is thoroughly explained.
Many of the ""basic concepts"" for Bash (and other modern shells) like e.g. function definitions, proper error handling, etc., are not even included in the course.
The importance of using correct quotations for variable/parameter expansions is also never mentioned nor explained, although it should be considered essential ""best practice"".
Peer-graded Final Assignment instructions/""guide"" contains some errors and not fully tested solutions, advertised as ""working correctly"".
The similar can be said about grading rubrics for the final assignment - which additionally are not focused on the actual results of the code execution, but instead they're focused on the code ""looks"", as in its visual resemblance (being as close to ""identical"" as possible) to what the course's staff have written in the grading rubrics.
In some cases, if the teaching staff finds a question in a discussion forum a bit more ""inconvenient"" for them to answer (or they're not fully capable of providing the correct answer to it in a timely manner?), then they would rather:
a) ignore the question completely (the least they can do is to not get involved at all) or reply with something similar to: ""we'll investigate the issue and get back to you"" (the latter ""get back to you"" almost never happens for a ""more complicated"" question);
b) reply with some irrelevant, impractical, incorrect, or otherwise unuseful information;
c) politely ask, to not bring the subject up ever again, as it may ""overwhelm the learners"";
d) delete the post (most often containing a valid, correct answer to the question) from discussion forums (I see censorship as ""means of hiding incompetence""?)
e) repeat other learner's correct answer (sometimes only slightly modifying it);
f) use and completely rely on AI LLM (e.g. ChatGPT, Bard, or other) and answers provided by it (which are mostly ridiculous), without even basic output verification; 
g) and also (occasionally) delete any relevant corrections (made by more knowledgeable learners) to previous staff's posts/replies;
than admit to any mistakes in the course contents, admit to lack of expertise in the subject matter, and address the questions properly - e.g. by allowing open discussion on potential improvements to the course materials, and implementing all said improvements as soon as possible (after reviewing).
These practices have been reported, and as I was assured by the Coursera Support Team, this kind of inappropriate teaching staff's behaviors will be escalated further, so I'm awaiting next developments of the situation.
But I still think this kind of inappropriate behaviors are a clear example, of what gives (or rather should give) the Skill-Up Technologies Pvt. Ltd. / SkillUp Online (employers for the most of ""teaching staff"") a bad reputation.
This also might give Coursera courses and IBM Skills Network a really bad publicity in a long-run.
Teaching and following ""best practices"", and answering doubts with relevant, thorough, technical knowledge in the discussion forums of this course... is something you unlikely/rarely find coming from the teaching staff.
Generally, teaching staff don't seem to be fit for the job of thoroughly explaining the course materials and teaching the proper ""understanding"" of your mistakes (as hard as they try to be seen ""cooperative""),
but as I see it, they're better suited for
a) only requesting you to ""copy and paste"" their code samples, that they believe should work best as a ""correct solution"" in their opinions (side note, again, ""my opinion"" - their code doesn't work all that great, and is not written with all the ""best practices"" in mind) and 
b) deleting ""inconvenient"" posts from the discussion forums whenever they please.
To sum it up: in its current form, and with its current teaching staff replying in the discussion forums, I'd definitely not recommend this course to anyone, especially beginners. And I'd discourage seeking any ""great"" learning experience from Skill-Up Technologies Pvt. Ltd. / SkillUp Online - thus I'd strongly suggest searching for some other, better resources on the subjects regarding basics of working with Linux CLI and shell scripting.

The course content seemed incomplete, lacking the depth and breadth that I have come to expect from IBM courses. This made it difficult to gain a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.",2

Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Volkert d V,"Jan 19, 2024","I have a few qualms on this still good, dense course: (1) - there is a lot of jargon that is taken for granted. For someone new to programming - you can easily get lost - especially when certain programs are only mentioned once and then taken to be known (e.g. Kubernetes, RedHat etc.) A cheat sheet would be very welcome. (2) the videos, while clear, are very dense, and the voice is very mono-tone which became quite a turn-down. To make sure students capture it it would be helpful to have more cross-checking questions during the lecture. (3) the final peer reviewed exercise is tricky and the peer review system doesn't work that great. with all the talk on automated checking in IBMs DevOps course I would think an automated check would be more effective - and could actually point out to you what you did wrong. for example - I had trouble figuring out a certain line of code and I actually asked chatGPT - turns out I had one space too much. in another case I came up with a slightly different code which did the same job.

Introductory Human Physiology,By Kin I R N,"Apr 16, 2018",I am an incoming medical student here in the Philippines and this course has provided me with enough background about the human body and the underlying machinery of every system associated with it. ,5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Maxine P M,"Jun 28, 2020","The primary reason for enrolling in the course was to enhance my knowledge base of human physiology. Although it has been many decades since I've taken anatomy and physiology as well as pathophysiology, I have taught it twice at the secondary level.  Upon reviewing the description of the course, it indicated that it was introductory, but knowledge of biology/science would be helpful, I thought it might be a great refresher course.  I beg to differ! This course WAS NOT introductory.  Let me give you the positives first: pdf's and readings were extremely helpful.  The negatives, the instructors were not impressive. One instructor talked absolutely too fast and much too often wouldn't complete the sentences OR she would repeat words or phrases that didn't make sense. I found it difficult to grasp the lecture when this instructor couldn't get through a sentence without stumbling over her thoughts, mumbling, trailing off and not finishing her sentence, etc. More often than not, the information provided in the lecture was inconsistent with the notes/pdf's. One other thing, she constantly smacked her mouth which was nerve-wrecking!  During the lectures, she would write on the powerpoints, which was either sloppy or not legible. After the fifth week, I honestly wanted to withdraw from the course, but decided to finish it out solely because it was half way completed and the time that had already been invested.  Many viewers gave the course 5 stars, I could not.  Although I completed the course with a 93.4% grade, the level of information was extensive, to some degree over the top.  The course needs to be restructured so that it stays within the context of an introductory course.  In my opinion, this course is more suitable for a first-second year medical student.  BTW, this is the sixth course that I have completed through Coursera, including a specialization.  Good luck!",2

Introductory Human Physiology,By Sylvia Q,"Jan 18, 2020","Great class - very dense, like drinking from a fire hose, but wow I learned a lot! I took this just because I wanted to learn more about how the body magically does what it does, every day, without me thinking about it. I had no prior experience in physiology or anatomy, so this required me to do a LOT of note-taking and a little bit of Googling on the side for further understanding. If a week's videos totaled 2 hours, I spent about 4-5 getting through them and taking notes. I should add that I did not use the forums regularly, but I saw that many students had, and that their questions were answered fairly promptly, often by Emma Jakoi herself. The end-of-unit quizzes always included questions which forced you to apply your new learning to cases, and these could be challenging! Thanks to Duke for making this great class available online for free.",5

Perhaps the second professor would have been better, but after 2 hours of listening to Dr. Jakoi, I now have to contact Coursera to see if I can get a refund or switch courses.",1
Introductory Human Physiology,By Anastasiia N,"Oct 24, 2015","The effect of this course in understanding the body physiology and understanding the terminology of other courses can be compared to learning to read.

Introductory Human Physiology,By Dustin J,"Aug 23, 2020","I'm a college freshman (majoring in nursing) and I took this course due to the pandemic. I found this course challenging since it focuses more on the physiology of the human body in more detail than a regular my anatomy and physiology class back in high school. This course isn't really an ""introductory"" course, you may need some background on science courses like chemistry, biology, anatomy, and physiology (So keep that in mind if you want to enroll). I have a limited background in science these courses (Biology, chemistry, etc) and finished this course, and yes it is possible to finish this course without knowing all about science stuff, it just took a little more effort to quickly learn science terms and stuff. With all of that, the course was great and for a nursing major like me really helped me developed surface-level knowledge about the function of the human body. Lectures are good, a little fast for me but they provide great PDF that I can refer to. Practice quizzes did help me a lot, but I hope that they provide feedback or explanation on why I got it wrong instead of just showing ""correct"" or ""incorrect"". It's worth my time learning physiology and I highly recommend it! Big thanks to the instructors and staff, especially Coursera for making this course free to the public!",5

All the lectures are very professionally conducted with clear notes in the resources.  Many times, video lectures provided very good external cases beyond the texts.

Introductory Human Physiology,By Christine A,"Apr 20, 2020","This course is excellent, if physiology is something you need for your career/personal interest. Mimi Jakoi and  Jennifer Carbrey are magnificent in their field, and they both provide their tremendous insight to a high-functioning foundation level for the subject. However, if you are someone like me, a middle school science teacher who was only looking to find a novice level of physiology, you are going to get above and beyond what you imagined. I would definitely recommend this course to those who are highly invested in the subject, as it provides a great breadth of detail to 10 human systems. ",5

reading, and an intense note-taking all along. I highly recommend anyone who
wants a ‘warm-up’ in college physiology to do this course. This is perhaps a
first college level physiology, but it’s no way ‘introductory’. For a student with
mostly humanities background like me, it’s going to be a challenging course.

First Step Korean,By Mailine Y,"Oct 25, 2019","This class was very hard to follow. Pronunciation is key to any language. This course does not help you become even close to basic proficiency because there is no pronunciation key available. The worksheets are so hard to follow because it's all in Hangul with no pronunciation key or english pronunciation available. For a beginner course, this should have been standard- we don't know how to read Hangul and it shouldn't be expected during a beginners course. This course has a lot of room for improvement and would be great once they are implemented to become more user friendly. Also, rather than just using Hangul and English words in the videos, there should be pronunciation underneath the Hangul to make sure students are really getting the words correct instead of them trying to figure out word it is and referring to worksheets all the time. I did not have a good time learning the language because it was so frustrating trying to figure out what she was saying exactly- thus making the quizzes even more difficult!!",2

Financial Markets,By Deleted A,"Apr 23, 2019","This course is virtually worthless. I couldn't follow the lectures, and I have a PhD and have been a tenured professor for almost two decades. The online course is based on snippets taken from face-to-face lectures and breakout sessions, and the result is utter incoherence. The instructor frequently refers to concepts that have not yet been encountered in the online version of the course; makes extensive use of mathematical notations and formulas whose variables are never properly explained; and generally does a poor job of explaining the material. This online version of the Yale course was obviously slapped together with very little thought and production value; it's one of those unsuccessful attempts to bring in revenue on the cheap, creating an online version out of existing face-to-face material, rather than building a real online course from scratch. This was wasted money and time. This attempt to capitalize on the Yale brand is pathetic.    ",1

The instructor and his team have taken great care to introduce topics in a manner simple enough for anyone to understand. While the course content may not go very in-depth into how a particular stock market works, or how particular stocks move, it provides great insight into why the stock market is necessary and relevant in our current society and how human behavior and its expression through policy and law can result in both financial progress and also crisis.

This course has brought to me the necessary skills to make more rational decisions in my life, in my future career, I think. It’s also helped me to realize how I should work in this sector to serve the right purposes, to make the people living around me to be better.

Financial Markets,By Aniket G,"May 20, 2019","It was not very interesting. The course needs to be more self-explanatory, with real world examples, and not dull",1
Financial Markets,By David S,"May 29, 2020",I find the professor is hard to understand because he is so slow in making a point.  I have listened to a few lectures and have given up.  I am going to look for another course.,1

Financial Markets,By Aayushi a,"Jun 16, 2020","Through this course, I have learned not only technical financial terms but much deeper meaning of the financial markets which I always wanted to understand. I feel very lucky that I took this course.",5
Financial Markets,By James N,"Jun 7, 2019","From a knowledge perspective, I have learned a lot about financial markets, why various financial instruments exist, and the applications/implications of them. With all due respect to the lecturer, he was not very engaging and did not really provide emphasis on key concepts to make it stick. When explaining the concepts, he would ""dilute"" it with extra words or go off talking about ""relevant"" back story without wrapping it all up at the end. I had to review most of the videos a second time.",3
Financial Markets,By Emmanuel I,"Mar 15, 2019","I enjoyed the course thoroughly, it was a little difficult at first because my background isn't in finance. However, I pushed myself  to understand the concepts and principles such that I started to enjoy it. The lectures were really engaging. Now I have foundational understanding of finance upon which I can build my knowledge and also my ability to make informed application.",5
Financial Markets,By Anthony S,"Jan 10, 2019","Some parts of the course were informative.  Some were disappointing.  Replaying it in my mind now that I'm done, I feel that the course dwelt on the flaws of financial markets, rather than being an explanation of their workings.  It was an indictment of markets more than I would have expected, instead of being instructive toward them.  There was a section toward the end on ""critics of finance"".  Far less effort was made in defense of modern finance (a wonderful field).",3
Financial Markets,By Maumau B,"Jun 30, 2019","You can never get bored with Professor Shiller. He is very passionate about how things work or how to make it happen, and will convince you that everything in life needed finance. He likes history and is a lifelong learner. I rated 5 stars because he made it simple for people to learn regardless of ages or education. ",5
Business Analysis & Process Management,By Thomas G,"Dec 15, 2020","""Pause and look at this doc ok welcome back now pause and do it yourself ok you now know how to write a business plan"". The instructor simply read a script verbatim with no punctuation, pauses, or personality. The whole thing was incredibly rushed, and ""rushed"" is not the same thing as ""fast paced"". Absolutely no justification for using the clunky Rhyme virtual desktop, as all you do is open a Google Doc and make a Lucid Chart account. Why would I log into my email and set up another account in your virtual desktop?",1
Business Analysis & Process Management,By Gisela W,"Dec 19, 2020","I like the hands-on platform and the approach of following along with the instructor side by side. However, the instructor speaks way too fast. I lowered the speed to 0.7 and was still struggling to follow. Also, at times the questions/instructions are not 100% clear or confusing so that I wasn't sure what to do and just kept watching. The content is quite superficial.

Business Analysis & Process Management,By Deleted A,"Feb 11, 2021","Coursera please remove this course!

"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By David J,"Apr 20, 2019","Course focuses more on forcing you to sign up for various IBM cloud tools than learning python.

The slide is completely unclear and there are some small mistakes in that. And the final project is aimless, I don't know why you come up with such a project for the beginner. Anyway, I'm so disappointed with IBM and this course. ",1
"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Julian L G,"Jan 4, 2019","It is amazing how bad this is considering that it is marketed as an IBM product. This is not the level of quality people expect when they hear the name IBM! You'd be better off paying 9.99 for a Udemy course than taking this course. It is not in depth at all and does a stunningly poor job at building real understanding and competency. The videos and labs are full of sloppiness and errors... again, not living up to the IBM name. I don't know about y'all, but I'm probably never going to pay money for a coursera course again... not really worth it.",1

"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Aykut Ö,"Mar 4, 2019","  As in the other parts of the certificate, the tasks are simply too easy. The content in the videos (many typos!!!!) are really valuable but the tasks man... Only the surface of the surface will be discussed, no deeping down into the wild. In this course the libraries numpy and pandas are presented but in the final assignment we actually don't needed the libs... When I read the description of the final assignment, I was excited because I assumed we will need to code EVERYTHING ourselves. So really do the thinking of how to solve the requirements, testing it in a notebook out, reading the docs, discovering new cool stuff... But unfortunately my dream did not come true. The most exciting function was already provided and some of the answers were little bit of copy and paste instead of really recalling newly learned knowledge. Before this review I really wanted to give 4 out of 5 stars but after writing this review I will now give only 2 stars. Actually, 2 stars are in my opinion unfair, since the creators have put a lot of time and love in the course content. Unfortunately, so much potential is thrown away  ",2

"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Steve O,"Oct 31, 2018","The IBM cloud ""service"" leaves much to be desired. Multiple times I've experienced outages while I was in the middle of lab assignments. It's a paid course where they give you ""free"" credits to do the course work in their cloud ""service."" But the credits are inadequate for the labs and they constantly ask for your credit card to buy more ""service.""

I spend many hours on a number of evenings figuring what was meant. If this lead to constructive learning, I'd be OK with it. But now it was just a long egg-hunt to figure out how I was to post something using idiosyncratic IBM infrastructure which taught me little about Python. Was this course even test driven?",1

Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Basil K,"May 18, 2022","There is so much information missing in the labs in this course esp starting from Week 3. The videos it seems like were put together in a hurry with crucial information missing and labs are even worse than the videos. They are expecting one to find, set, unset files in extremely long scripts without providing any information on how it is done. Furthermore, there is little to no information given on why certain commands are called what they are called making this course not at all intuitive.

Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Amanda W,"Aug 2, 2022","This course is terrible for beginners!! None of the modules go in depth, it was difficult to understand because none of the commands are explained, and the final project is super advanced for what is actually taught in the class. I feel like I learned almost nothing!",1
Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Mateusz K,"Jan 24, 2024","Everything that follows, is just my own personal opinion, if not stated otherwise. It is based on my observations and interactions with teaching staff in the course discussion forums (for the last few months).
This is a very poorly executed course.
As of today (23 Jan 2024) this course for me still does not meet the criteria of a ""good resource for learning"" the basics of Linux CLI and shell scripting (despite few minor improvements already applied).
Some of the topics are hastily skimmed through in the videos, and almost no mechanism presented in the course is thoroughly explained.
Many of the ""basic concepts"" for Bash (and other modern shells) like e.g. function definitions, proper error handling, etc., are not even included in the course.
The importance of using correct quotations for variable/parameter expansions is also never mentioned nor explained, although it should be considered essential ""best practice"".
Peer-graded Final Assignment instructions/""guide"" contains some errors and not fully tested solutions, advertised as ""working correctly"".
The similar can be said about grading rubrics for the final assignment - which additionally are not focused on the actual results of the code execution, but instead they're focused on the code ""looks"", as in its visual resemblance (being as close to ""identical"" as possible) to what the course's staff have written in the grading rubrics.
In some cases, if the teaching staff finds a question in a discussion forum a bit more ""inconvenient"" for them to answer (or they're not fully capable of providing the correct answer to it in a timely manner?), then they would rather:
a) ignore the question completely (the least they can do is to not get involved at all) or reply with something similar to: ""we'll investigate the issue and get back to you"" (the latter ""get back to you"" almost never happens for a ""more complicated"" question);
b) reply with some irrelevant, impractical, incorrect, or otherwise unuseful information;
c) politely ask, to not bring the subject up ever again, as it may ""overwhelm the learners"";
d) delete the post (most often containing a valid, correct answer to the question) from discussion forums (I see censorship as ""means of hiding incompetence""?)
e) repeat other learner's correct answer (sometimes only slightly modifying it);
f) use and completely rely on AI LLM (e.g. ChatGPT, Bard, or other) and answers provided by it (which are mostly ridiculous), without even basic output verification; 
g) and also (occasionally) delete any relevant corrections (made by more knowledgeable learners) to previous staff's posts/replies;
than admit to any mistakes in the course contents, admit to lack of expertise in the subject matter, and address the questions properly - e.g. by allowing open discussion on potential improvements to the course materials, and implementing all said improvements as soon as possible (after reviewing).
These practices have been reported, and as I was assured by the Coursera Support Team, this kind of inappropriate teaching staff's behaviors will be escalated further, so I'm awaiting next developments of the situation.
But I still think this kind of inappropriate behaviors are a clear example, of what gives (or rather should give) the Skill-Up Technologies Pvt. Ltd. / SkillUp Online (employers for the most of ""teaching staff"") a bad reputation.
This also might give Coursera courses and IBM Skills Network a really bad publicity in a long-run.
Teaching and following ""best practices"", and answering doubts with relevant, thorough, technical knowledge in the discussion forums of this course... is something you unlikely/rarely find coming from the teaching staff.
Generally, teaching staff don't seem to be fit for the job of thoroughly explaining the course materials and teaching the proper ""understanding"" of your mistakes (as hard as they try to be seen ""cooperative""),
but as I see it, they're better suited for
a) only requesting you to ""copy and paste"" their code samples, that they believe should work best as a ""correct solution"" in their opinions (side note, again, ""my opinion"" - their code doesn't work all that great, and is not written with all the ""best practices"" in mind) and 
b) deleting ""inconvenient"" posts from the discussion forums whenever they please.
To sum it up: in its current form, and with its current teaching staff replying in the discussion forums, I'd definitely not recommend this course to anyone, especially beginners. And I'd discourage seeking any ""great"" learning experience from Skill-Up Technologies Pvt. Ltd. / SkillUp Online - thus I'd strongly suggest searching for some other, better resources on the subjects regarding basics of working with Linux CLI and shell scripting.

Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Volkert d V,"Jan 19, 2024","I have a few qualms on this still good, dense course: (1) - there is a lot of jargon that is taken for granted. For someone new to programming - you can easily get lost - especially when certain programs are only mentioned once and then taken to be known (e.g. Kubernetes, RedHat etc.) A cheat sheet would be very welcome. (2) the videos, while clear, are very dense, and the voice is very mono-tone which became quite a turn-down. To make sure students capture it it would be helpful to have more cross-checking questions during the lecture. (3) the final peer reviewed exercise is tricky and the peer review system doesn't work that great. with all the talk on automated checking in IBMs DevOps course I would think an automated check would be more effective - and could actually point out to you what you did wrong. for example - I had trouble figuring out a certain line of code and I actually asked chatGPT - turns out I had one space too much. in another case I came up with a slightly different code which did the same job.

Introductory Human Physiology,By Lucy L,"Jun 2, 2016",I'm a high school student interested in human physiology. ,5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Kin I R N,"Apr 16, 2018",I am an incoming medical student here in the Philippines and this course has provided me with enough background about the human body and the underlying machinery of every system associated with it. ,5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Maxine P M,"Jun 28, 2020","The primary reason for enrolling in the course was to enhance my knowledge base of human physiology. Although it has been many decades since I've taken anatomy and physiology as well as pathophysiology, I have taught it twice at the secondary level.  Upon reviewing the description of the course, it indicated that it was introductory, but knowledge of biology/science would be helpful, I thought it might be a great refresher course.  I beg to differ! This course WAS NOT introductory.  Let me give you the positives first: pdf's and readings were extremely helpful.  The negatives, the instructors were not impressive. One instructor talked absolutely too fast and much too often wouldn't complete the sentences OR she would repeat words or phrases that didn't make sense. I found it difficult to grasp the lecture when this instructor couldn't get through a sentence without stumbling over her thoughts, mumbling, trailing off and not finishing her sentence, etc. More often than not, the information provided in the lecture was inconsistent with the notes/pdf's. One other thing, she constantly smacked her mouth which was nerve-wrecking!  During the lectures, she would write on the powerpoints, which was either sloppy or not legible. After the fifth week, I honestly wanted to withdraw from the course, but decided to finish it out solely because it was half way completed and the time that had already been invested.  Many viewers gave the course 5 stars, I could not.  Although I completed the course with a 93.4% grade, the level of information was extensive, to some degree over the top.  The course needs to be restructured so that it stays within the context of an introductory course.  In my opinion, this course is more suitable for a first-second year medical student.  BTW, this is the sixth course that I have completed through Coursera, including a specialization.  Good luck!",2
Introductory Human Physiology,By Jade D,"Jan 5, 2021","Best course I've ever taken!  Detailed and thorough explanations of the systems of the body.  Fascinating, enlightening, and enjoyable.  Highly recommend for anyone interested in how the body functions.",5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Sylvia Q,"Jan 18, 2020","Great class - very dense, like drinking from a fire hose, but wow I learned a lot! I took this just because I wanted to learn more about how the body magically does what it does, every day, without me thinking about it. I had no prior experience in physiology or anatomy, so this required me to do a LOT of note-taking and a little bit of Googling on the side for further understanding. If a week's videos totaled 2 hours, I spent about 4-5 getting through them and taking notes. I should add that I did not use the forums regularly, but I saw that many students had, and that their questions were answered fairly promptly, often by Emma Jakoi herself. The end-of-unit quizzes always included questions which forced you to apply your new learning to cases, and these could be challenging! Thanks to Duke for making this great class available online for free.",5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Dave H,"Oct 11, 2016",I gained a deeper understanding and greater appreciation for how my body works.  Thank you to the Teams at Duke and Coursera for making such a wide body of information available to the motivated. ,5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Joshua S,"Dec 9, 2019"," It is so hard to learn from a professor who can't get through 2  sentences without stumbling over her thoughts, mumbling, trailing off  and not finishing her sentence, etc. Perhaps if she spent less time  pretending to be John Madden with her little board, she could focus on  being an effective orator. Perhaps the second professor would have been better, but after 2 hours of listening to Dr. Jakoi, I now have to contact Coursera to see if I can get a refund or switch courses.",1
Introductory Human Physiology,By Anastasiia N,"Oct 24, 2015","The effect of this course in understanding the body physiology and understanding the terminology of other courses can be compared to learning to read. Now I can take other, more specialized courses without having to Google every other word and actually understand the processes they're talking about instead of simply memorizing them. ",5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Dustin J,"Aug 23, 2020","I'm a college freshman (majoring in nursing) and I took this course due to the pandemic. I found this course challenging since it focuses more on the physiology of the human body in more detail than a regular my anatomy and physiology class back in high school. This course isn't really an ""introductory"" course, you may need some background on science courses like chemistry, biology, anatomy, and physiology (So keep that in mind if you want to enroll). I have a limited background in science these courses (Biology, chemistry, etc) and finished this course, and yes it is possible to finish this course without knowing all about science stuff, it just took a little more effort to quickly learn science terms and stuff. With all of that, the course was great and for a nursing major like me really helped me developed surface-level knowledge about the function of the human body. Lectures are good, a little fast for me but they provide great PDF that I can refer to. Practice quizzes did help me a lot, but I hope that they provide feedback or explanation on why I got it wrong instead of just showing ""correct"" or ""incorrect"". It's worth my time learning physiology and I highly recommend it! Big thanks to the instructors and staff, especially Coursera for making this course free to the public!",5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Karen J,"May 10, 2020","Definitely, this is not an introductory course. Actually, you need some prior background in physiology, biology, chemistry, anatomy before taking it. It is also very challenging!  ",5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Ariane M,"Nov 4, 2017",Very very interesting but also very challenging. I would not say this is a beginner's physiology course. Very much worth doing if you are interested in the medical field of some sort. ,4
Introductory Human Physiology,By Lucie P,"Jul 26, 2016","This course seems to require a high level of foundation knowledge that I don't have. I had to leave the course before completion because of that. In fact, most of the videos were too complex to understand without prior knowledge on the matter and the deadlines are quite tight to have time to research all the topics.",3

Introductory Human Physiology,By Jonathan H,"Sep 21, 2019","An extremely wonderful course to a non-medical but with only high school biology background person like me.  It helps me to gain better knowledge and information to what happens to our body in response to all those external influences of stress, intake of food and liquid.  All the lectures are very professionally conducted with clear notes in the resources.  Many times, video lectures provided very good external cases beyond the texts.  I must also respect that both of you continue with the lectures despite hearing coughing many times throughout.  Great professionalism demonstrated, even in such coursera.co course.",5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Christine A,"Apr 20, 2020","This course is excellent, if physiology is something you need for your career/personal interest. Mimi Jakoi and  Jennifer Carbrey are magnificent in their field, and they both provide their tremendous insight to a high-functioning foundation level for the subject. However, if you are someone like me, a middle school science teacher who was only looking to find a novice level of physiology, you are going to get above and beyond what you imagined. I would definitely recommend this course to those who are highly invested in the subject, as it provides a great breadth of detail to 10 human systems. ",5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Parvathy s n,"May 28, 2022",it was a fun ride to be a part of this journey of learning  HUMAN PHYSIOLOGY .....it was very much helpful for understanding the basic concepts of our body how our body functions internally as well their hormonal capabilities. i feel really confident now because the lecture was easy to understand i thoroughly enjoyed. thank you. ,5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Pei-Hsuan L,"Jun 12, 2020","I don't speak for everyone, but this course was relatively difficult for an introductory course. It required an adequate amount of base/foundation on the subject in order for one to understand what the lesson is talking about. ",3

Introductory Human Physiology,By Bryony R,"Feb 10, 2019",I am about to start a degree in nursing and this was an excellent introduction.  The pace was quite fast and the content is quite technical but through rereading the materials and watching some supplementary explanations (such as Khan academy) it all made sense. Thank you for all for all of the hard work required to create such a comprehensive course,5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Calista L,"Oct 8, 2020","Great things first: It’s a great course, with quite an
amount of information each video each module. For each week’s two to three
video hours, I spent 5 to 6 hours researching through googling or textbook
reading, and an intense note-taking all along. I highly recommend anyone who
wants a ‘warm-up’ in college physiology to do this course. This is perhaps a
first college level physiology, but it’s no way ‘introductory’. For a student with
mostly humanities background like me, it’s going to be a challenging course.
But it is really worth doing.",5

First Step Korean,By Amelia N,"May 18, 2020",A really good starting point to understand what's the Hangeul is constituted of and have a taste test on daily conversation. Last 2 modules were of quick pace which encourages me to revisit more often,5
First Step Korean,By Mailine Y,"Oct 25, 2019","This class was very hard to follow. Pronunciation is key to any language. This course does not help you become even close to basic proficiency because there is no pronunciation key available. The worksheets are so hard to follow because it's all in Hangul with no pronunciation key or english pronunciation available. For a beginner course, this should have been standard- we don't know how to read Hangul and it shouldn't be expected during a beginners course. This course has a lot of room for improvement and would be great once they are implemented to become more user friendly. Also, rather than just using Hangul and English words in the videos, there should be pronunciation underneath the Hangul to make sure students are really getting the words correct instead of them trying to figure out word it is and referring to worksheets all the time. I did not have a good time learning the language because it was so frustrating trying to figure out what she was saying exactly- thus making the quizzes even more difficult!!",2
First Step Korean,By Lynne,"Dec 16, 2016",It was very well organised and presented. There was good opportunity for repetition in the videos and good opportunity to study the main written expressions and grammar in the PDF files. Excellent!,5

I did still learn a great deal of vocabulary.",3

I do think that you have to come into this course with an understanding of the Korean alphabet and basic knowledge of how to compose and read letters. Once you have that down, this course definitely helps you begin to move forward in becoming fluent with verbal and written comprehension. You definitely have to practice and repeat your practice consistently to retain your new knowledge. I love this course. Thank you!",5

First Step Korean,By Kathy C,"Feb 15, 2017","This was a good course, but much more ambitious than the description or name suggests.  I had to watch the videos at 75% speed in order to figure out what was actually said, as I have never heard any Korean before.  I used the quizlet flashcards and some youtube videos in order to learn the material, as the ""lecture notes"" were not always very helpful.  So in all, a good course if you can access some supplementary activities.  In fact, adding the quizlet flashcards to the lesson either before the lecture or before the quiz would be helpful for future students.  I plan to take the class again in order to master the material.",3

Financial Markets,By Deleted A,"Apr 23, 2019","This course is virtually worthless. I couldn't follow the lectures, and I have a PhD and have been a tenured professor for almost two decades. The online course is based on snippets taken from face-to-face lectures and breakout sessions, and the result is utter incoherence. The instructor frequently refers to concepts that have not yet been encountered in the online version of the course; makes extensive use of mathematical notations and formulas whose variables are never properly explained; and generally does a poor job of explaining the material. This online version of the Yale course was obviously slapped together with very little thought and production value; it's one of those unsuccessful attempts to bring in revenue on the cheap, creating an online version out of existing face-to-face material, rather than building a real online course from scratch. This was wasted money and time. This attempt to capitalize on the Yale brand is pathetic.    ",1

The strongest point of this course is the simplicity with which it conveys the importance and relevance of finance in today's world. The instructor and his team have taken great care to introduce topics in a manner simple enough for anyone to understand. While the course content may not go very in-depth into how a particular stock market works, or how particular stocks move, it provides great insight into why the stock market is necessary and relevant in our current society and how human behavior and its expression through policy and law can result in both financial progress and also crisis.

I have gained the basic knowledge of financial markets and their applications in reality. Absolutely right, finance is not just about making money that I thought before joining in this course, and as a popular opinion as well, it is more than that, it has much more meaningful. This course has brought to me the necessary skills to make more rational decisions in my life, in my future career, I think. It’s also helped me to realize how I should work in this sector to serve the right purposes, to make the people living around me to be better. And it’s true that educational finance is very important to everyone. Professor Robert Shiller is an amazing teacher, many thanks to Professor Robert Shiller and Yale’s Financial Markets Course team.

Financial Markets,By Anthony S,"Jan 10, 2019","Some parts of the course were informative.  Some were disappointing.  Replaying it in my mind now that I'm done, I feel that the course dwelt on the flaws of financial markets, rather than being an explanation of their workings.  It was an indictment of markets more than I would have expected, instead of being instructive toward them.  There was a section toward the end on ""critics of finance"".  Far less effort was made in defense of modern finance (a wonderful field).",3

"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By David J,"Apr 20, 2019","Course focuses more on forcing you to sign up for various IBM cloud tools than learning python.  The final assignment has a 300+ reply thread in the discussion forum because you are graded on the ability to integrate your IBM Watson Notebook with IBM cloud storage, but the instructions have multiple errors, such as not working if you provision your storage in the wrong region.",1

The slide is completely unclear and there are some small mistakes in that. And the final project is aimless, I don't know why you come up with such a project for the beginner. Anyway, I'm so disappointed with IBM and this course. ",1
"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Julian L G,"Jan 4, 2019","It is amazing how bad this is considering that it is marketed as an IBM product. This is not the level of quality people expect when they hear the name IBM! You'd be better off paying 9.99 for a Udemy course than taking this course. It is not in depth at all and does a stunningly poor job at building real understanding and competency. The videos and labs are full of sloppiness and errors... again, not living up to the IBM name. I don't know about y'all, but I'm probably never going to pay money for a coursera course again... not really worth it.",1

"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Aykut Ö,"Mar 4, 2019","  As in the other parts of the certificate, the tasks are simply too easy. The content in the videos (many typos!!!!) are really valuable but the tasks man... Only the surface of the surface will be discussed, no deeping down into the wild. In this course the libraries numpy and pandas are presented but in the final assignment we actually don't needed the libs... When I read the description of the final assignment, I was excited because I assumed we will need to code EVERYTHING ourselves. So really do the thinking of how to solve the requirements, testing it in a notebook out, reading the docs, discovering new cool stuff... But unfortunately my dream did not come true. The most exciting function was already provided and some of the answers were little bit of copy and paste instead of really recalling newly learned knowledge. Before this review I really wanted to give 4 out of 5 stars but after writing this review I will now give only 2 stars. Actually, 2 stars are in my opinion unfair, since the creators have put a lot of time and love in the course content. Unfortunately, so much potential is thrown away  ",2

"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Steve O,"Oct 31, 2018","The IBM cloud ""service"" leaves much to be desired.

I spend many hours on a number of evenings figuring what was meant. If this lead to constructive learning, I'd be OK with it. But now it was just a long egg-hunt to figure out how I was to post something using idiosyncratic IBM infrastructure which taught me little about Python. Was this course even test driven?",1

Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Basil K,"May 18, 2022","There is so much information missing in the labs in this course esp starting from Week 3. The videos it seems like were put together in a hurry with crucial information missing and labs are even worse than the videos. They are expecting one to find, set, unset files in extremely long scripts without providing any information on how it is done. Furthermore, there is little to no information given on why certain commands are called what they are called making this course not at all intuitive. I wish someone else has reviewed this course before putting it online. Such a wasted opportunity to educate people. ",1

I feel like I learned almost nothing!",1
Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Mateusz K,"Jan 24, 2024","Everything that follows, is just my own personal opinion, if not stated otherwise. It is based on my observations and interactions with teaching staff in the course discussion forums (for the last few months).
This is a very poorly executed course.
As of today (23 Jan 2024) this course for me still does not meet the criteria of a ""good resource for learning"" the basics of Linux CLI and shell scripting (despite few minor improvements already applied).
Some of the topics are hastily skimmed through in the videos, and almost no mechanism presented in the course is thoroughly explained.
Many of the ""basic concepts"" for Bash (and other modern shells) like e.g. function definitions, proper error handling, etc., are not even included in the course.
The importance of using correct quotations for variable/parameter expansions is also never mentioned nor explained, although it should be considered essential ""best practice"".
Peer-graded Final Assignment instructions/""guide"" contains some errors and not fully tested solutions, advertised as ""working correctly"".
The similar can be said about grading rubrics for the final assignment - which additionally are not focused on the actual results of the code execution, but instead they're focused on the code ""looks"", as in its visual resemblance (being as close to ""identical"" as possible) to what the course's staff have written in the grading rubrics.
In some cases, if the teaching staff finds a question in a discussion forum a bit more ""inconvenient"" for them to answer (or they're not fully capable of providing the correct answer to it in a timely manner?), then they would rather:
a) ignore the question completely (the least they can do is to not get involved at all) or reply with something similar to: ""we'll investigate the issue and get back to you"" (the latter ""get back to you"" almost never happens for a ""more complicated"" question);
b) reply with some irrelevant, impractical, incorrect, or otherwise unuseful information;
c) politely ask, to not bring the subject up ever again, as it may ""overwhelm the learners"";
d) delete the post (most often containing a valid, correct answer to the question) from discussion forums (I see censorship as ""means of hiding incompetence""?)
e) repeat other learner's correct answer (sometimes only slightly modifying it);
f) use and completely rely on AI LLM (e.g. ChatGPT, Bard, or other) and answers provided by it (which are mostly ridiculous), without even basic output verification; 
g) and also (occasionally) delete any relevant corrections (made by more knowledgeable learners) to previous staff's posts/replies;
than admit to any mistakes in the course contents, admit to lack of expertise in the subject matter, and address the questions properly - e.g. by allowing open discussion on potential improvements to the course materials, and implementing all said improvements as soon as possible (after reviewing).
These practices have been reported, and as I was assured by the Coursera Support Team, this kind of inappropriate teaching staff's behaviors will be escalated further, so I'm awaiting next developments of the situation.
But I still think this kind of inappropriate behaviors are a clear example, of what gives (or rather should give) the Skill-Up Technologies Pvt. Ltd. / SkillUp Online (employers for the most of ""teaching staff"") a bad reputation.
This also might give Coursera courses and IBM Skills Network a really bad publicity in a long-run.
Teaching and following ""best practices"", and answering doubts with relevant, thorough, technical knowledge in the discussion forums of this course... is something you unlikely/rarely find coming from the teaching staff.
Generally, teaching staff don't seem to be fit for the job of thoroughly explaining the course materials and teaching the proper ""understanding"" of your mistakes (as hard as they try to be seen ""cooperative""),
but as I see it, they're better suited for
a) only requesting you to ""copy and paste"" their code samples, that they believe should work best as a ""correct solution"" in their opinions (side note, again, ""my opinion"" - their code doesn't work all that great, and is not written with all the ""best practices"" in mind) and 
b) deleting ""inconvenient"" posts from the discussion forums whenever they please.
To sum it up: in its current form, and with its current teaching staff replying in the discussion forums, I'd definitely not recommend this course to anyone, especially beginners. And I'd discourage seeking any ""great"" learning experience from Skill-Up Technologies Pvt. Ltd. / SkillUp Online - thus I'd strongly suggest searching for some other, better resources on the subjects regarding basics of working with Linux CLI and shell scripting.

Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Volkert d V,"Jan 19, 2024","I have a few qualms on this still good, dense course: (1) - there is a lot of jargon that is taken for granted. For someone new to programming - you can easily get lost - especially when certain programs are only mentioned once and then taken to be known (e.g. Kubernetes, RedHat etc.) A cheat sheet would be very welcome. (2) the videos, while clear, are very dense, and the voice is very mono-tone which became quite a turn-down. To make sure students capture it it would be helpful to have more cross-checking questions during the lecture. (3) the final peer reviewed exercise is tricky and the peer review system doesn't work that great. with all the talk on automated checking in IBMs DevOps course I would think an automated check would be more effective - and could actually point out to you what you did wrong. for example - I had trouble figuring out a certain line of code and I actually asked chatGPT - turns out I had one space too much. in another case I came up with a slightly different code which did the same job.

Introductory Human Physiology,By Maxine P M,"Jun 28, 2020","The primary reason for enrolling in the course was to enhance my knowledge base of human physiology. Although it has been many decades since I've taken anatomy and physiology as well as pathophysiology, I have taught it twice at the secondary level.  Upon reviewing the description of the course, it indicated that it was introductory, but knowledge of biology/science would be helpful, I thought it might be a great refresher course.  I beg to differ! This course WAS NOT introductory.  Let me give you the positives first: pdf's and readings were extremely helpful.  The negatives, the instructors were not impressive. One instructor talked absolutely too fast and much too often wouldn't complete the sentences OR she would repeat words or phrases that didn't make sense. I found it difficult to grasp the lecture when this instructor couldn't get through a sentence without stumbling over her thoughts, mumbling, trailing off and not finishing her sentence, etc. More often than not, the information provided in the lecture was inconsistent with the notes/pdf's. One other thing, she constantly smacked her mouth which was nerve-wrecking!  During the lectures, she would write on the powerpoints, which was either sloppy or not legible. After the fifth week, I honestly wanted to withdraw from the course, but decided to finish it out solely because it was half way completed and the time that had already been invested.  Many viewers gave the course 5 stars, I could not.  Although I completed the course with a 93.4% grade, the level of information was extensive, to some degree over the top.  The course needs to be restructured so that it stays within the context of an introductory course.  In my opinion, this course is more suitable for a first-second year medical student.  BTW, this is the sixth course that I have completed through Coursera, including a specialization.  Good luck!",2

I took this just because I wanted to learn more about how the body magically does what it does, every day, without me thinking about it. I had no prior experience in physiology or anatomy, so this required me to do a LOT of note-taking and a little bit of Googling on the side for further understanding. If a week's videos totaled 2 hours, I spent about 4-5 getting through them and taking notes. I should add that I did not use the forums regularly, but I saw that many students had, and that their questions were answered fairly promptly, often by Emma Jakoi herself. The end-of-unit quizzes always included questions which forced you to apply your new learning to cases, and these could be challenging! Thanks to Duke for making this great class available online for free.",5

Perhaps the second professor would have been better, but after 2 hours of listening to Dr. Jakoi, I now have to contact Coursera to see if I can get a refund or switch courses.",1

Introductory Human Physiology,By Dustin J,"Aug 23, 2020","I'm a college freshman (majoring in nursing) and I took this course due to the pandemic. I found this course challenging since it focuses more on the physiology of the human body in more detail than a regular my anatomy and physiology class back in high school. This course isn't really an ""introductory"" course, you may need some background on science courses like chemistry, biology, anatomy, and physiology (So keep that in mind if you want to enroll). I have a limited background in science these courses (Biology, chemistry, etc) and finished this course, and yes it is possible to finish this course without knowing all about science stuff, it just took a little more effort to quickly learn science terms and stuff. With all of that, the course was great and for a nursing major like me really helped me developed surface-level knowledge about the function of the human body. Lectures are good, a little fast for me but they provide great PDF that I can refer to. Practice quizzes did help me a lot, but I hope that they provide feedback or explanation on why I got it wrong instead of just showing ""correct"" or ""incorrect"". It's worth my time learning physiology and I highly recommend it! Big thanks to the instructors and staff, especially Coursera for making this course free to the public!",5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Karen J,"May 10, 2020","Definitely, this is not an introductory course. Actually, you need some prior background in physiology, biology, chemistry, anatomy before taking it. It is also very challenging!  ",5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Ariane M,"Nov 4, 2017",Very very interesting but also very challenging. I would not say this is a beginner's physiology course. Very much worth doing if you are interested in the medical field of some sort. ,4
Introductory Human Physiology,By Lucie P,"Jul 26, 2016","This course seems to require a high level of foundation knowledge that I don't have.

Introductory Human Physiology,By Jonathan H,"Sep 21, 2019","An extremely wonderful course to a non-medical but with only high school biology background person like me.  It helps me to gain better knowledge and information to what happens to our body in response to all those external influences of stress, intake of food and liquid.  All the lectures are very professionally conducted with clear notes in the resources.  Many times, video lectures provided very good external cases beyond the texts.  I must also respect that both of you continue with the lectures despite hearing coughing many times throughout.  Great professionalism demonstrated, even in such coursera.co course.",5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Christine A,"Apr 20, 2020","This course is excellent, if physiology is something you need for your career/personal interest. Mimi Jakoi and  Jennifer Carbrey are magnificent in their field, and they both provide their tremendous insight to a high-functioning foundation level for the subject. However, if you are someone like me, a middle school science teacher who was only looking to find a novice level of physiology, you are going to get above and beyond what you imagined. I would definitely recommend this course to those who are highly invested in the subject, as it provides a great breadth of detail to 10 human systems. ",5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Parvathy s n,"May 28, 2022",it was a fun ride to be a part of this journey of learning  HUMAN PHYSIOLOGY .....it was very much helpful for understanding the basic concepts of our body how our body functions internally as well their hormonal capabilities. i feel really confident now because the lecture was easy to understand i thoroughly enjoyed. thank you. ,5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Pei-Hsuan L,"Jun 12, 2020","I don't speak for everyone, but this course was relatively difficult for an introductory course. It required an adequate amount of base/foundation on the subject in order for one to understand what the lesson is talking about. ",3

Introductory Human Physiology,By Bryony R,"Feb 10, 2019",I am about to start a degree in nursing and this was an excellent introduction.  The pace was quite fast and the content is quite technical but through rereading the materials and watching some supplementary explanations (such as Khan academy) it all made sense. Thank you for all for all of the hard work required to create such a comprehensive course,5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Calista L,"Oct 8, 2020","Great things first: It’s a great course, with quite an
amount of information each video each module. For each week’s two to three
video hours, I spent 5 to 6 hours researching through googling or textbook
reading, and an intense note-taking all along. I highly recommend anyone who
wants a ‘warm-up’ in college physiology to do this course. This is perhaps a
first college level physiology, but it’s no way ‘introductory’. For a student with
mostly humanities background like me, it’s going to be a challenging course.
But it is really worth doing.",5

First Step Korean,By Mailine Y,"Oct 25, 2019","This class was very hard to follow. Pronunciation is key to any language. This course does not help you become even close to basic proficiency because there is no pronunciation key available. The worksheets are so hard to follow because it's all in Hangul with no pronunciation key or english pronunciation available. For a beginner course, this should have been standard- we don't know how to read Hangul and it shouldn't be expected during a beginners course. This course has a lot of room for improvement and would be great once they are implemented to become more user friendly. Also, rather than just using Hangul and English words in the videos, there should be pronunciation underneath the Hangul to make sure students are really getting the words correct instead of them trying to figure out word it is and referring to worksheets all the time. I did not have a good time learning the language because it was so frustrating trying to figure out what she was saying exactly- thus making the quizzes even more difficult!!",2
First Step Korean,By Lynne,"Dec 16, 2016",It was very well organised and presented. There was good opportunity for repetition in the videos and good opportunity to study the main written expressions and grammar in the PDF files. Excellent!,5

I did still learn a great deal of vocabulary.",3

First Step Korean,By jenn (,"Nov 30, 2018","This is the first online course where I can begin to understand how to put sentence structure together and begin to understand honorifics. I do think that you have to come into this course with an understanding of the Korean alphabet and basic knowledge of how to compose and read letters. Once you have that down, this course definitely helps you begin to move forward in becoming fluent with verbal and written comprehension. You definitely have to practice and repeat your practice consistently to retain your new knowledge. I love this course. Thank you!",5
First Step Korean,By Büşra G,"Oct 17, 2017",I wish there was korean subtitles instead of [FOREIGN] .,3
First Step Korean,By Kathy C,"Feb 15, 2017","This was a good course, but much more ambitious than the description or name suggests.  I had to watch the videos at 75% speed in order to figure out what was actually said, as I have never heard any Korean before.  I used the quizlet flashcards and some youtube videos in order to learn the material, as the ""lecture notes"" were not always very helpful.  So in all, a good course if you can access some supplementary activities.  In fact, adding the quizlet flashcards to the lesson either before the lecture or before the quiz would be helpful for future students.  I plan to take the class again in order to master the material.",3

Financial Markets,By Deleted A,"Apr 23, 2019","This course is virtually worthless. I couldn't follow the lectures, and I have a PhD and have been a tenured professor for almost two decades. The online course is based on snippets taken from face-to-face lectures and breakout sessions, and the result is utter incoherence. The instructor frequently refers to concepts that have not yet been encountered in the online version of the course; makes extensive use of mathematical notations and formulas whose variables are never properly explained; and generally does a poor job of explaining the material. This online version of the Yale course was obviously slapped together with very little thought and production value; it's one of those unsuccessful attempts to bring in revenue on the cheap, creating an online version out of existing face-to-face material, rather than building a real online course from scratch. This was wasted money and time. This attempt to capitalize on the Yale brand is pathetic.    ",1
Financial Markets,By Sanam P,"Oct 23, 2017","This course was horrible! The Content was very disoriented and unclear. Videos were distorted, and jumping from one topic to another. There was no sense of continuity. One can not say this was a course from Yale...",1

Financial Markets,By Tiyash B,"May 3, 2018","A great introductory level course which is recommended for anyone with a remote interest in finance irrespective of whether they have a background in finance or economics. The strongest point of this course is the simplicity with which it conveys the importance and relevance of finance in today's world. The instructor and his team have taken great care to introduce topics in a manner simple enough for anyone to understand. While the course content may not go very in-depth into how a particular stock market works, or how particular stocks move, it provides great insight into why the stock market is necessary and relevant in our current society and how human behavior and its expression through policy and law can result in both financial progress and also crisis.

Financial Markets,By Doan T L ,"May 26, 2019","It’s a good online course in Finance that I have never learned before. I have gained the basic knowledge of financial markets and their applications in reality. Absolutely right, finance is not just about making money that I thought before joining in this course, and as a popular opinion as well, it is more than that, it has much more meaningful. This course has brought to me the necessary skills to make more rational decisions in my life, in my future career, I think. It’s also helped me to realize how I should work in this sector to serve the right purposes, to make the people living around me to be better. And it’s true that educational finance is very important to everyone. Professor Robert Shiller is an amazing teacher, many thanks to Professor Robert Shiller and Yale’s Financial Markets Course team. I highly recommend taking this course! ",5
Financial Markets,By Stefano E,"Mar 17, 2019","Probably the best financial market course on coursera. Intense and very rich in content. Too much,  though.

Now I have foundational understanding of finance upon which I can build my knowledge and also my ability to make informed application.",5
Financial Markets,By Anthony S,"Jan 10, 2019","Some parts of the course were informative.  Some were disappointing.  Replaying it in my mind now that I'm done, I feel that the course dwelt on the flaws of financial markets, rather than being an explanation of their workings.  It was an indictment of markets more than I would have expected, instead of being instructive toward them.  There was a section toward the end on ""critics of finance"".  Far less effort was made in defense of modern finance (a wonderful field).",3
Financial Markets,By Maumau B,"Jun 30, 2019","You can never get bored with Professor Shiller.

The instructor simply read a script verbatim with no punctuation, pauses, or personality. The whole thing was incredibly rushed, and ""rushed"" is not the same thing as ""fast paced"".

So really do the thinking of how to solve the requirements, testing it in a notebook out, reading the docs, discovering new cool stuff... But unfortunately my dream did not come true.

Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Basil K,"May 18, 2022","There is so much information missing in the labs in this course esp starting from Week 3. The videos it seems like were put together in a hurry with crucial information missing and labs are even worse than the videos. They are expecting one to find, set, unset files in extremely long scripts without providing any information on how it is done. Furthermore, there is little to no information given on why certain commands are called what they are called making this course not at all intuitive. I wish someone else has reviewed this course before putting it online. Such a wasted opportunity to educate people. ",1
Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Tyler M,"Jan 18, 2022","This need a lot more hands-on experience and explaining the *why* of commands. The course never explained any logic behind operators and commands, so it was never clear how everything worked.",3

Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Amanda W,"Aug 2, 2022","This course is terrible for beginners!! None of the modules go in depth, it was difficult to understand because none of the commands are explained, and the final project is super advanced for what is actually taught in the class. I feel like I learned almost nothing!",1
Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Mateusz K,"Jan 24, 2024","Everything that follows, is just my own personal opinion, if not stated otherwise. It is based on my observations and interactions with teaching staff in the course discussion forums (for the last few months).
This is a very poorly executed course.
As of today (23 Jan 2024) this course for me still does not meet the criteria of a ""good resource for learning"" the basics of Linux CLI and shell scripting (despite few minor improvements already applied).
Some of the topics are hastily skimmed through in the videos, and almost no mechanism presented in the course is thoroughly explained.
Many of the ""basic concepts"" for Bash (and other modern shells) like e.g. function definitions, proper error handling, etc., are not even included in the course.
The importance of using correct quotations for variable/parameter expansions is also never mentioned nor explained, although it should be considered essential ""best practice"".
Peer-graded Final Assignment instructions/""guide"" contains some errors and not fully tested solutions, advertised as ""working correctly"".
The similar can be said about grading rubrics for the final assignment - which additionally are not focused on the actual results of the code execution, but instead they're focused on the code ""looks"", as in its visual resemblance (being as close to ""identical"" as possible) to what the course's staff have written in the grading rubrics.
In some cases, if the teaching staff finds a question in a discussion forum a bit more ""inconvenient"" for them to answer (or they're not fully capable of providing the correct answer to it in a timely manner?), then they would rather:
a) ignore the question completely (the least they can do is to not get involved at all) or reply with something similar to: ""we'll investigate the issue and get back to you"" (the latter ""get back to you"" almost never happens for a ""more complicated"" question);
b) reply with some irrelevant, impractical, incorrect, or otherwise unuseful information;
c) politely ask, to not bring the subject up ever again, as it may ""overwhelm the learners"";
d) delete the post (most often containing a valid, correct answer to the question) from discussion forums (I see censorship as ""means of hiding incompetence""?)
e) repeat other learner's correct answer (sometimes only slightly modifying it);
f) use and completely rely on AI LLM (e.g. ChatGPT, Bard, or other) and answers provided by it (which are mostly ridiculous), without even basic output verification; 
g) and also (occasionally) delete any relevant corrections (made by more knowledgeable learners) to previous staff's posts/replies;
than admit to any mistakes in the course contents, admit to lack of expertise in the subject matter, and address the questions properly - e.g. by allowing open discussion on potential improvements to the course materials, and implementing all said improvements as soon as possible (after reviewing).
These practices have been reported, and as I was assured by the Coursera Support Team, this kind of inappropriate teaching staff's behaviors will be escalated further, so I'm awaiting next developments of the situation.
But I still think this kind of inappropriate behaviors are a clear example, of what gives (or rather should give) the Skill-Up Technologies Pvt. Ltd. / SkillUp Online (employers for the most of ""teaching staff"") a bad reputation.
This also might give Coursera courses and IBM Skills Network a really bad publicity in a long-run.
Teaching and following ""best practices"", and answering doubts with relevant, thorough, technical knowledge in the discussion forums of this course... is something you unlikely/rarely find coming from the teaching staff.
Generally, teaching staff don't seem to be fit for the job of thoroughly explaining the course materials and teaching the proper ""understanding"" of your mistakes (as hard as they try to be seen ""cooperative""),
but as I see it, they're better suited for
a) only requesting you to ""copy and paste"" their code samples, that they believe should work best as a ""correct solution"" in their opinions (side note, again, ""my opinion"" - their code doesn't work all that great, and is not written with all the ""best practices"" in mind) and 
b) deleting ""inconvenient"" posts from the discussion forums whenever they please.
To sum it up: in its current form, and with its current teaching staff replying in the discussion forums, I'd definitely not recommend this course to anyone, especially beginners. And I'd discourage seeking any ""great"" learning experience from Skill-Up Technologies Pvt. Ltd. / SkillUp Online - thus I'd strongly suggest searching for some other, better resources on the subjects regarding basics of working with Linux CLI and shell scripting.

Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Volkert d V,"Jan 19, 2024","I have a few qualms on this still good, dense course: (1) - there is a lot of jargon that is taken for granted. For someone new to programming - you can easily get lost - especially when certain programs are only mentioned once and then taken to be known (e.g. Kubernetes, RedHat etc.) A cheat sheet would be very welcome. (2) the videos, while clear, are very dense, and the voice is very mono-tone which became quite a turn-down. To make sure students capture it it would be helpful to have more cross-checking questions during the lecture. (3) the final peer reviewed exercise is tricky and the peer review system doesn't work that great. with all the talk on automated checking in IBMs DevOps course I would think an automated check would be more effective - and could actually point out to you what you did wrong. for example - I had trouble figuring out a certain line of code and I actually asked chatGPT - turns out I had one space too much. in another case I came up with a slightly different code which did the same job.

Introductory Human Physiology,By Maxine P M,"Jun 28, 2020","The primary reason for enrolling in the course was to enhance my knowledge base of human physiology. Although it has been many decades since I've taken anatomy and physiology as well as pathophysiology, I have taught it twice at the secondary level.  Upon reviewing the description of the course, it indicated that it was introductory, but knowledge of biology/science would be helpful, I thought it might be a great refresher course.  I beg to differ! This course WAS NOT introductory.  Let me give you the positives first: pdf's and readings were extremely helpful.  The negatives, the instructors were not impressive. One instructor talked absolutely too fast and much too often wouldn't complete the sentences OR she would repeat words or phrases that didn't make sense. I found it difficult to grasp the lecture when this instructor couldn't get through a sentence without stumbling over her thoughts, mumbling, trailing off and not finishing her sentence, etc. More often than not, the information provided in the lecture was inconsistent with the notes/pdf's. One other thing, she constantly smacked her mouth which was nerve-wrecking!  During the lectures, she would write on the powerpoints, which was either sloppy or not legible. After the fifth week, I honestly wanted to withdraw from the course, but decided to finish it out solely because it was half way completed and the time that had already been invested.  Many viewers gave the course 5 stars, I could not.  Although I completed the course with a 93.4% grade, the level of information was extensive, to some degree over the top.  The course needs to be restructured so that it stays within the context of an introductory course.  In my opinion, this course is more suitable for a first-second year medical student.  BTW, this is the sixth course that I have completed through Coursera, including a specialization.  Good luck!",2

Introductory Human Physiology,By Sylvia Q,"Jan 18, 2020","Great class - very dense, like drinking from a fire hose, but wow I learned a lot! I took this just because I wanted to learn more about how the body magically does what it does, every day, without me thinking about it. I had no prior experience in physiology or anatomy, so this required me to do a LOT of note-taking and a little bit of Googling on the side for further understanding. If a week's videos totaled 2 hours, I spent about 4-5 getting through them and taking notes. I should add that I did not use the forums regularly, but I saw that many students had, and that their questions were answered fairly promptly, often by Emma Jakoi herself. The end-of-unit quizzes always included questions which forced you to apply your new learning to cases, and these could be challenging! Thanks to Duke for making this great class available online for free.",5

Introductory Human Physiology,By Joshua S,"Dec 9, 2019"," It is so hard to learn from a professor who can't get through 2  sentences without stumbling over her thoughts, mumbling, trailing off  and not finishing her sentence, etc. Perhaps if she spent less time  pretending to be John Madden with her little board, she could focus on  being an effective orator. Perhaps the second professor would have been better, but after 2 hours of listening to Dr. Jakoi, I now have to contact Coursera to see if I can get a refund or switch courses.",1

Introductory Human Physiology,By Dustin J,"Aug 23, 2020","I'm a college freshman (majoring in nursing) and I took this course due to the pandemic. I found this course challenging since it focuses more on the physiology of the human body in more detail than a regular my anatomy and physiology class back in high school. This course isn't really an ""introductory"" course, you may need some background on science courses like chemistry, biology, anatomy, and physiology (So keep that in mind if you want to enroll). I have a limited background in science these courses (Biology, chemistry, etc) and finished this course, and yes it is possible to finish this course without knowing all about science stuff, it just took a little more effort to quickly learn science terms and stuff. With all of that, the course was great and for a nursing major like me really helped me developed surface-level knowledge about the function of the human body. Lectures are good, a little fast for me but they provide great PDF that I can refer to. Practice quizzes did help me a lot, but I hope that they provide feedback or explanation on why I got it wrong instead of just showing ""correct"" or ""incorrect"". It's worth my time learning physiology and I highly recommend it! Big thanks to the instructors and staff, especially Coursera for making this course free to the public!",5

Introductory Human Physiology,By Christine A,"Apr 20, 2020","This course is excellent, if physiology is something you need for your career/personal interest. Mimi Jakoi and  Jennifer Carbrey are magnificent in their field, and they both provide their tremendous insight to a high-functioning foundation level for the subject. However, if you are someone like me, a middle school science teacher who was only looking to find a novice level of physiology, you are going to get above and beyond what you imagined. I would definitely recommend this course to those who are highly invested in the subject, as it provides a great breadth of detail to 10 human systems. ",5

reading, and an intense note-taking all along. I highly recommend anyone who
wants a ‘warm-up’ in college physiology to do this course. This is perhaps a
first college level physiology, but it’s no way ‘introductory’. For a student with
mostly humanities background like me, it’s going to be a challenging course.

First Step Korean,By Mailine Y,"Oct 25, 2019","This class was very hard to follow. Pronunciation is key to any language. This course does not help you become even close to basic proficiency because there is no pronunciation key available. The worksheets are so hard to follow because it's all in Hangul with no pronunciation key or english pronunciation available. For a beginner course, this should have been standard- we don't know how to read Hangul and it shouldn't be expected during a beginners course. This course has a lot of room for improvement and would be great once they are implemented to become more user friendly. Also, rather than just using Hangul and English words in the videos, there should be pronunciation underneath the Hangul to make sure students are really getting the words correct instead of them trying to figure out word it is and referring to worksheets all the time.

First Step Korean,By Diana S ,"Mar 31, 2020","Fue una experiencia maravillosa, más allá de aprender coreano, pude aprender más de su cultura. Esto fue muy emocionante, en cada clase aprendes vocabulario, gramática, pronunciación, y sobre todo te diviertes. La profesora Seung Hae Kang, es una gran maestra que junto a su equipo han logrado elaborar material didáctico que permite aprender de un modo sencillo este hermosos idioma. Te recomiendo al 100% este curso, aprende y disfrútalo. ",5
First Step Korean,By LeapingFrog E,"Nov 17, 2016","Although the instructor was good at presenting the information, I felt that the reference sheets should of had the phonetic pronunciations next to the Korean writing. This would of helped learn the symbols better. After the second week, we were expected to know what they represented. I felt it needed a video on just learning the alphabet. I did still learn a great deal of vocabulary.",3

First Step Korean,By jenn (,"Nov 30, 2018","This is the first online course where I can begin to understand how to put sentence structure together and begin to understand honorifics. I do think that you have to come into this course with an understanding of the Korean alphabet and basic knowledge of how to compose and read letters. Once you have that down, this course definitely helps you begin to move forward in becoming fluent with verbal and written comprehension. You definitely have to practice and repeat your practice consistently to retain your new knowledge. I love this course. Thank you!",5
First Step Korean,By Büşra G,"Oct 17, 2017",I wish there was korean subtitles instead of [FOREIGN] .,3
First Step Korean,By Kathy C,"Feb 15, 2017","This was a good course, but much more ambitious than the description or name suggests.  I had to watch the videos at 75% speed in order to figure out what was actually said, as I have never heard any Korean before.  I used the quizlet flashcards and some youtube videos in order to learn the material, as the ""lecture notes"" were not always very helpful.  So in all, a good course if you can access some supplementary activities.  In fact, adding the quizlet flashcards to the lesson either before the lecture or before the quiz would be helpful for future students.  I plan to take the class again in order to master the material.",3

Financial Markets,By Deleted A,"Apr 23, 2019","This course is virtually worthless. I couldn't follow the lectures, and I have a PhD and have been a tenured professor for almost two decades. The online course is based on snippets taken from face-to-face lectures and breakout sessions, and the result is utter incoherence. The instructor frequently refers to concepts that have not yet been encountered in the online version of the course; makes extensive use of mathematical notations and formulas whose variables are never properly explained; and generally does a poor job of explaining the material. This online version of the Yale course was obviously slapped together with very little thought and production value; it's one of those unsuccessful attempts to bring in revenue on the cheap, creating an online version out of existing face-to-face material, rather than building a real online course from scratch. This was wasted money and time. This attempt to capitalize on the Yale brand is pathetic.    ",1

Financial Markets,By Tiyash B,"May 3, 2018","A great introductory level course which is recommended for anyone with a remote interest in finance irrespective of whether they have a background in finance or economics. The strongest point of this course is the simplicity with which it conveys the importance and relevance of finance in today's world. The instructor and his team have taken great care to introduce topics in a manner simple enough for anyone to understand. While the course content may not go very in-depth into how a particular stock market works, or how particular stocks move, it provides great insight into why the stock market is necessary and relevant in our current society and how human behavior and its expression through policy and law can result in both financial progress and also crisis.

Financial Markets,By Erik M,"Nov 4, 2018",This was really a great experience. A course taught by a valued teach. Enjoyed it all the way though I would have liked more mathematical and theoretical models. But then where do you end in a MOOC ?,5
Financial Markets,By Doan T L ,"May 26, 2019","It’s a good online course in Finance that I have never learned before. I have gained the basic knowledge of financial markets and their applications in reality. Absolutely right, finance is not just about making money that I thought before joining in this course, and as a popular opinion as well, it is more than that, it has much more meaningful. This course has brought to me the necessary skills to make more rational decisions in my life, in my future career, I think. It’s also helped me to realize how I should work in this sector to serve the right purposes, to make the people living around me to be better. And it’s true that educational finance is very important to everyone. Professor Robert Shiller is an amazing teacher, many thanks to Professor Robert Shiller and Yale’s Financial Markets Course team. I highly recommend taking this course! ",5
Financial Markets,By Stefano E,"Mar 17, 2019","Probably the best financial market course on coursera. Intense and very rich in content. Too much,  though. Many topics would require more than a 10 minute video to be properly understood, and some lectures were difficult to follow. I'd probably reduce the content and focus on less topics but giving them more time.",3

Financial Markets,By James N,"Jun 7, 2019","From a knowledge perspective, I have learned a lot about financial markets, why various financial instruments exist, and the applications/implications of them. With all due respect to the lecturer, he was not very engaging and did not really provide emphasis on key concepts to make it stick. When explaining the concepts, he would ""dilute"" it with extra words or go off talking about ""relevant"" back story without wrapping it all up at the end. I had to review most of the videos a second time.",3
Financial Markets,By Emmanuel I,"Mar 15, 2019","I enjoyed the course thoroughly, it was a little difficult at first because my background isn't in finance. However, I pushed myself  to understand the concepts and principles such that I started to enjoy it. The lectures were really engaging. Now I have foundational understanding of finance upon which I can build my knowledge and also my ability to make informed application.",5
Financial Markets,By Anthony S,"Jan 10, 2019","Some parts of the course were informative.  Some were disappointing.  Replaying it in my mind now that I'm done, I feel that the course dwelt on the flaws of financial markets, rather than being an explanation of their workings.  It was an indictment of markets more than I would have expected, instead of being instructive toward them.  There was a section toward the end on ""critics of finance"".  Far less effort was made in defense of modern finance (a wonderful field).",3
Financial Markets,By Maumau B,"Jun 30, 2019","You can never get bored with Professor Shiller. He is very passionate about how things work or how to make it happen, and will convince you that everything in life needed finance. He likes history and is a lifelong learner.

Business Analysis & Process Management,By Thomas G,"Dec 15, 2020","""Pause and look at this doc ok welcome back now pause and do it yourself ok you now know how to write a business plan"". The instructor simply read a script verbatim with no punctuation, pauses, or personality. The whole thing was incredibly rushed, and ""rushed"" is not the same thing as ""fast paced"". Absolutely no justification for using the clunky Rhyme virtual desktop, as all you do is open a Google Doc and make a Lucid Chart account.

Business Analysis & Process Management,By Gisela W,"Dec 19, 2020","I like the hands-on platform and the approach of following along with the instructor side by side.

In this course the libraries numpy and pandas are presented but in the final assignment we actually don't needed the libs... When I read the description of the final assignment, I was excited because I assumed we will need to code EVERYTHING ourselves. So really do the thinking of how to solve the requirements, testing it in a notebook out, reading the docs, discovering new cool stuff... But unfortunately my dream did not come true. The most exciting function was already provided and some of the answers were little bit of copy and paste instead of really recalling newly learned knowledge. Before this review I really wanted to give 4 out of 5 stars but after writing this review I will now give only 2 stars.

Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Basil K,"May 18, 2022","There is so much information missing in the labs in this course esp starting from Week 3. The videos it seems like were put together in a hurry with crucial information missing and labs are even worse than the videos. They are expecting one to find, set, unset files in extremely long scripts without providing any information on how it is done. Furthermore, there is little to no information given on why certain commands are called what they are called making this course not at all intuitive. I wish someone else has reviewed this course before putting it online. Such a wasted opportunity to educate people. ",1
Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Tyler M,"Jan 18, 2022","This need a lot more hands-on experience and explaining the *why* of commands. The course never explained any logic behind operators and commands, so it was never clear how everything worked.",3

Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Amanda W,"Aug 2, 2022","This course is terrible for beginners!!

I feel like I learned almost nothing!",1
Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Mateusz K,"Jan 24, 2024","Everything that follows, is just my own personal opinion, if not stated otherwise. It is based on my observations and interactions with teaching staff in the course discussion forums (for the last few months).
This is a very poorly executed course.
As of today (23 Jan 2024) this course for me still does not meet the criteria of a ""good resource for learning"" the basics of Linux CLI and shell scripting (despite few minor improvements already applied).
Some of the topics are hastily skimmed through in the videos, and almost no mechanism presented in the course is thoroughly explained.
Many of the ""basic concepts"" for Bash (and other modern shells) like e.g. function definitions, proper error handling, etc., are not even included in the course.
The importance of using correct quotations for variable/parameter expansions is also never mentioned nor explained, although it should be considered essential ""best practice"".
Peer-graded Final Assignment instructions/""guide"" contains some errors and not fully tested solutions, advertised as ""working correctly"".
The similar can be said about grading rubrics for the final assignment - which additionally are not focused on the actual results of the code execution, but instead they're focused on the code ""looks"", as in its visual resemblance (being as close to ""identical"" as possible) to what the course's staff have written in the grading rubrics.
In some cases, if the teaching staff finds a question in a discussion forum a bit more ""inconvenient"" for them to answer (or they're not fully capable of providing the correct answer to it in a timely manner?), then they would rather:
a) ignore the question completely (the least they can do is to not get involved at all) or reply with something similar to: ""we'll investigate the issue and get back to you"" (the latter ""get back to you"" almost never happens for a ""more complicated"" question);
b) reply with some irrelevant, impractical, incorrect, or otherwise unuseful information;
c) politely ask, to not bring the subject up ever again, as it may ""overwhelm the learners"";
d) delete the post (most often containing a valid, correct answer to the question) from discussion forums (I see censorship as ""means of hiding incompetence""?)
e) repeat other learner's correct answer (sometimes only slightly modifying it);
f) use and completely rely on AI LLM (e.g. ChatGPT, Bard, or other) and answers provided by it (which are mostly ridiculous), without even basic output verification; 
g) and also (occasionally) delete any relevant corrections (made by more knowledgeable learners) to previous staff's posts/replies;
than admit to any mistakes in the course contents, admit to lack of expertise in the subject matter, and address the questions properly - e.g. by allowing open discussion on potential improvements to the course materials, and implementing all said improvements as soon as possible (after reviewing).
These practices have been reported, and as I was assured by the Coursera Support Team, this kind of inappropriate teaching staff's behaviors will be escalated further, so I'm awaiting next developments of the situation.
But I still think this kind of inappropriate behaviors are a clear example, of what gives (or rather should give) the Skill-Up Technologies Pvt. Ltd. / SkillUp Online (employers for the most of ""teaching staff"") a bad reputation.
This also might give Coursera courses and IBM Skills Network a really bad publicity in a long-run.
Teaching and following ""best practices"", and answering doubts with relevant, thorough, technical knowledge in the discussion forums of this course... is something you unlikely/rarely find coming from the teaching staff.
Generally, teaching staff don't seem to be fit for the job of thoroughly explaining the course materials and teaching the proper ""understanding"" of your mistakes (as hard as they try to be seen ""cooperative""),
but as I see it, they're better suited for
a) only requesting you to ""copy and paste"" their code samples, that they believe should work best as a ""correct solution"" in their opinions (side note, again, ""my opinion"" - their code doesn't work all that great, and is not written with all the ""best practices"" in mind) and 
b) deleting ""inconvenient"" posts from the discussion forums whenever they please.
To sum it up: in its current form, and with its current teaching staff replying in the discussion forums, I'd definitely not recommend this course to anyone, especially beginners. And I'd discourage seeking any ""great"" learning experience from Skill-Up Technologies Pvt. Ltd. / SkillUp Online - thus I'd strongly suggest searching for some other, better resources on the subjects regarding basics of working with Linux CLI and shell scripting.

Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Volkert d V,"Jan 19, 2024","I have a few qualms on this still good, dense course: (1) - there is a lot of jargon that is taken for granted. For someone new to programming - you can easily get lost - especially when certain programs are only mentioned once and then taken to be known (e.g. Kubernetes, RedHat etc.) A cheat sheet would be very welcome. (2) the videos, while clear, are very dense, and the voice is very mono-tone which became quite a turn-down. To make sure students capture it it would be helpful to have more cross-checking questions during the lecture. (3) the final peer reviewed exercise is tricky and the peer review system doesn't work that great. with all the talk on automated checking in IBMs DevOps course I would think an automated check would be more effective - and could actually point out to you what you did wrong. for example - I had trouble figuring out a certain line of code and I actually asked chatGPT - turns out I had one space too much. in another case I came up with a slightly different code which did the same job.

Introductory Human Physiology,By Maxine P M,"Jun 28, 2020","The primary reason for enrolling in the course was to enhance my knowledge base of human physiology. Although it has been many decades since I've taken anatomy and physiology as well as pathophysiology, I have taught it twice at the secondary level.  Upon reviewing the description of the course, it indicated that it was introductory, but knowledge of biology/science would be helpful, I thought it might be a great refresher course.  I beg to differ! This course WAS NOT introductory.  Let me give you the positives first: pdf's and readings were extremely helpful.  The negatives, the instructors were not impressive. One instructor talked absolutely too fast and much too often wouldn't complete the sentences OR she would repeat words or phrases that didn't make sense. I found it difficult to grasp the lecture when this instructor couldn't get through a sentence without stumbling over her thoughts, mumbling, trailing off and not finishing her sentence, etc. More often than not, the information provided in the lecture was inconsistent with the notes/pdf's. One other thing, she constantly smacked her mouth which was nerve-wrecking!  During the lectures, she would write on the powerpoints, which was either sloppy or not legible. After the fifth week, I honestly wanted to withdraw from the course, but decided to finish it out solely because it was half way completed and the time that had already been invested.  Many viewers gave the course 5 stars, I could not.  Although I completed the course with a 93.4% grade, the level of information was extensive, to some degree over the top.  The course needs to be restructured so that it stays within the context of an introductory course.  In my opinion, this course is more suitable for a first-second year medical student.  BTW, this is the sixth course that I have completed through Coursera, including a specialization.  Good luck!",2

Introductory Human Physiology,By Sylvia Q,"Jan 18, 2020","Great class - very dense, like drinking from a fire hose, but wow I learned a lot! I took this just because I wanted to learn more about how the body magically does what it does, every day, without me thinking about it. I had no prior experience in physiology or anatomy, so this required me to do a LOT of note-taking and a little bit of Googling on the side for further understanding. If a week's videos totaled 2 hours, I spent about 4-5 getting through them and taking notes. I should add that I did not use the forums regularly, but I saw that many students had, and that their questions were answered fairly promptly, often by Emma Jakoi herself. The end-of-unit quizzes always included questions which forced you to apply your new learning to cases, and these could be challenging! Thanks to Duke for making this great class available online for free.",5

Introductory Human Physiology,By Joshua S,"Dec 9, 2019"," It is so hard to learn from a professor who can't get through 2  sentences without stumbling over her thoughts, mumbling, trailing off  and not finishing her sentence, etc. Perhaps if she spent less time  pretending to be John Madden with her little board, she could focus on  being an effective orator. Perhaps the second professor would have been better, but after 2 hours of listening to Dr. Jakoi, I now have to contact Coursera to see if I can get a refund or switch courses.",1
Introductory Human Physiology,By Anastasiia N,"Oct 24, 2015","The effect of this course in understanding the body physiology and understanding the terminology of other courses can be compared to learning to read.

Introductory Human Physiology,By Dustin J,"Aug 23, 2020","I'm a college freshman (majoring in nursing) and I took this course due to the pandemic. I found this course challenging since it focuses more on the physiology of the human body in more detail than a regular my anatomy and physiology class back in high school. This course isn't really an ""introductory"" course, you may need some background on science courses like chemistry, biology, anatomy, and physiology (So keep that in mind if you want to enroll). I have a limited background in science these courses (Biology, chemistry, etc) and finished this course, and yes it is possible to finish this course without knowing all about science stuff, it just took a little more effort to quickly learn science terms and stuff. With all of that, the course was great and for a nursing major like me really helped me developed surface-level knowledge about the function of the human body. Lectures are good, a little fast for me but they provide great PDF that I can refer to. Practice quizzes did help me a lot, but I hope that they provide feedback or explanation on why I got it wrong instead of just showing ""correct"" or ""incorrect"". It's worth my time learning physiology and I highly recommend it! Big thanks to the instructors and staff, especially Coursera for making this course free to the public!",5

All the lectures are very professionally conducted with clear notes in the resources.  Many times, video lectures provided very good external cases beyond the texts.

Introductory Human Physiology,By Christine A,"Apr 20, 2020","This course is excellent, if physiology is something you need for your career/personal interest. Mimi Jakoi and  Jennifer Carbrey are magnificent in their field, and they both provide their tremendous insight to a high-functioning foundation level for the subject. However, if you are someone like me, a middle school science teacher who was only looking to find a novice level of physiology, you are going to get above and beyond what you imagined. I would definitely recommend this course to those who are highly invested in the subject, as it provides a great breadth of detail to 10 human systems. ",5

reading, and an intense note-taking all along. I highly recommend anyone who
wants a ‘warm-up’ in college physiology to do this course. This is perhaps a
first college level physiology, but it’s no way ‘introductory’. For a student with
mostly humanities background like me, it’s going to be a challenging course.

First Step Korean,By Mailine Y,"Oct 25, 2019","This class was very hard to follow. Pronunciation is key to any language. This course does not help you become even close to basic proficiency because there is no pronunciation key available. The worksheets are so hard to follow because it's all in Hangul with no pronunciation key or english pronunciation available. For a beginner course, this should have been standard- we don't know how to read Hangul and it shouldn't be expected during a beginners course. This course has a lot of room for improvement and would be great once they are implemented to become more user friendly. Also, rather than just using Hangul and English words in the videos, there should be pronunciation underneath the Hangul to make sure students are really getting the words correct instead of them trying to figure out word it is and referring to worksheets all the time. I did not have a good time learning the language because it was so frustrating trying to figure out what she was saying exactly- thus making the quizzes even more difficult!!",2

Financial Markets,By Deleted A,"Apr 23, 2019","This course is virtually worthless. I couldn't follow the lectures, and I have a PhD and have been a tenured professor for almost two decades. The online course is based on snippets taken from face-to-face lectures and breakout sessions, and the result is utter incoherence. The instructor frequently refers to concepts that have not yet been encountered in the online version of the course; makes extensive use of mathematical notations and formulas whose variables are never properly explained; and generally does a poor job of explaining the material. This online version of the Yale course was obviously slapped together with very little thought and production value; it's one of those unsuccessful attempts to bring in revenue on the cheap, creating an online version out of existing face-to-face material, rather than building a real online course from scratch. This was wasted money and time. This attempt to capitalize on the Yale brand is pathetic.    ",1
Financial Markets,By Sanam P,"Oct 23, 2017","This course was horrible! The Content was very disoriented and unclear. Videos were distorted, and jumping from one topic to another. There was no sense of continuity. One can not say this was a course from Yale...",1

Financial Markets,By Eli,"Sep 18, 2017",This course was aweful! I feel like I didnt learn anything useful. The information is very superficial. The math that is applied at some points is not well explained. The overall course lacks structure and substance. The quizes were just terrible. Please dont waste your time with this.,1
Financial Markets,By Ibnu N H,"Mar 11, 2021",This course is easy to follow and interesting. Professor Shiller is very motivating. It not teaching about finance but more importantly how finance can build a better life for all. Really recommended.,5

Financial Markets,By Alexander v D,"Aug 28, 2017",Great introductory course. Prof. Schiller's enthusiasm and style make it a pleasure to watch. Also the TA's and the group discussions interspersed in the course make it a very personable experience.,5
Financial Markets,By Tiyash B,"May 3, 2018","A great introductory level course which is recommended for anyone with a remote interest in finance irrespective of whether they have a background in finance or economics. The strongest point of this course is the simplicity with which it conveys the importance and relevance of finance in today's world. The instructor and his team have taken great care to introduce topics in a manner simple enough for anyone to understand. While the course content may not go very in-depth into how a particular stock market works, or how particular stocks move, it provides great insight into why the stock market is necessary and relevant in our current society and how human behavior and its expression through policy and law can result in both financial progress and also crisis. ",5
Financial Markets,By Erik M,"Nov 4, 2018",This was really a great experience. A course taught by a valued teach. Enjoyed it all the way though I would have liked more mathematical and theoretical models. But then where do you end in a MOOC ?,5
Financial Markets,By Doan T L ,"May 26, 2019","It’s a good online course in Finance that I have never learned before. I have gained the basic knowledge of financial markets and their applications in reality. Absolutely right, finance is not just about making money that I thought before joining in this course, and as a popular opinion as well, it is more than that, it has much more meaningful. This course has brought to me the necessary skills to make more rational decisions in my life, in my future career, I think. It’s also helped me to realize how I should work in this sector to serve the right purposes, to make the people living around me to be better. And it’s true that educational finance is very important to everyone. Professor Robert Shiller is an amazing teacher, many thanks to Professor Robert Shiller and Yale’s Financial Markets Course team. I highly recommend taking this course! ",5
Financial Markets,By Stefano E,"Mar 17, 2019","Probably the best financial market course on coursera. Intense and very rich in content. Too much,  though. Many topics would require more than a 10 minute video to be properly understood, and some lectures were difficult to follow. I'd probably reduce the content and focus on less topics but giving them more time.",3

Financial Markets,By James N,"Jun 7, 2019","From a knowledge perspective, I have learned a lot about financial markets, why various financial instruments exist, and the applications/implications of them. With all due respect to the lecturer, he was not very engaging and did not really provide emphasis on key concepts to make it stick. When explaining the concepts, he would ""dilute"" it with extra words or go off talking about ""relevant"" back story without wrapping it all up at the end. I had to review most of the videos a second time.",3
Financial Markets,By Emmanuel I,"Mar 15, 2019","I enjoyed the course thoroughly, it was a little difficult at first because my background isn't in finance. However, I pushed myself  to understand the concepts and principles such that I started to enjoy it. The lectures were really engaging. Now I have foundational understanding of finance upon which I can build my knowledge and also my ability to make informed application.",5
Financial Markets,By Anthony S,"Jan 10, 2019","Some parts of the course were informative.  Some were disappointing.  Replaying it in my mind now that I'm done, I feel that the course dwelt on the flaws of financial markets, rather than being an explanation of their workings.  It was an indictment of markets more than I would have expected, instead of being instructive toward them.  There was a section toward the end on ""critics of finance"".  Far less effort was made in defense of modern finance (a wonderful field).",3
Financial Markets,By Maumau B,"Jun 30, 2019","You can never get bored with Professor Shiller. He is very passionate about how things work or how to make it happen, and will convince you that everything in life needed finance. He likes history and is a lifelong learner. I rated 5 stars because he made it simple for people to learn regardless of ages or education. ",5
Business Analysis & Process Management,By Thomas G,"Dec 15, 2020","""Pause and look at this doc ok welcome back now pause and do it yourself ok you now know how to write a business plan"". The instructor simply read a script verbatim with no punctuation, pauses, or personality. The whole thing was incredibly rushed, and ""rushed"" is not the same thing as ""fast paced"". Absolutely no justification for using the clunky Rhyme virtual desktop, as all you do is open a Google Doc and make a Lucid Chart account. Why would I log into my email and set up another account in your virtual desktop?",1
Business Analysis & Process Management,By Gisela W,"Dec 19, 2020","I like the hands-on platform and the approach of following along with the instructor side by side. However, the instructor speaks way too fast. I lowered the speed to 0.7 and was still struggling to follow. Also, at times the questions/instructions are not 100% clear or confusing so that I wasn't sure what to do and just kept watching. The content is quite superficial. The project does give you some guidance in modeling a simple business process using Lucidchart which I appreciate.",2
Business Analysis & Process Management,By Deleted A,"Feb 11, 2021","Coursera please remove this course!

"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Julian L G,"Jan 4, 2019","It is amazing how bad this is considering that it is marketed as an IBM product. This is not the level of quality people expect when they hear the name IBM! You'd be better off paying 9.99 for a Udemy course than taking this course. It is not in depth at all and does a stunningly poor job at building real understanding and competency. The videos and labs are full of sloppiness and errors... again, not living up to the IBM name.

"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Aykut Ö,"Mar 4, 2019","  As in the other parts of the certificate, the tasks are simply too easy. The content in the videos (many typos!!!!) are really valuable but the tasks man... Only the surface of the surface will be discussed, no deeping down into the wild. In this course the libraries numpy and pandas are presented but in the final assignment we actually don't needed the libs... When I read the description of the final assignment, I was excited because I assumed we will need to code EVERYTHING ourselves. So really do the thinking of how to solve the requirements, testing it in a notebook out, reading the docs, discovering new cool stuff... But unfortunately my dream did not come true. The most exciting function was already provided and some of the answers were little bit of copy and paste instead of really recalling newly learned knowledge. Before this review I really wanted to give 4 out of 5 stars but after writing this review I will now give only 2 stars. Actually, 2 stars are in my opinion unfair, since the creators have put a lot of time and love in the course content. Unfortunately, so much potential is thrown away  ",2

Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Basil K,"May 18, 2022","There is so much information missing in the labs in this course esp starting from Week 3. The videos it seems like were put together in a hurry with crucial information missing and labs are even worse than the videos. They are expecting one to find, set, unset files in extremely long scripts without providing any information on how it is done. Furthermore, there is little to no information given on why certain commands are called what they are called making this course not at all intuitive. I wish someone else has reviewed this course before putting it online. Such a wasted opportunity to educate people. ",1
Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Tyler M,"Jan 18, 2022","This need a lot more hands-on experience and explaining the *why* of commands. The course never explained any logic behind operators and commands, so it was never clear how everything worked.",3

Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Amanda W,"Aug 2, 2022","This course is terrible for beginners!! None of the modules go in depth, it was difficult to understand because none of the commands are explained, and the final project is super advanced for what is actually taught in the class. I feel like I learned almost nothing!",1
Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Mateusz K,"Jan 24, 2024","Everything that follows, is just my own personal opinion, if not stated otherwise. It is based on my observations and interactions with teaching staff in the course discussion forums (for the last few months).
This is a very poorly executed course.
As of today (23 Jan 2024) this course for me still does not meet the criteria of a ""good resource for learning"" the basics of Linux CLI and shell scripting (despite few minor improvements already applied).
Some of the topics are hastily skimmed through in the videos, and almost no mechanism presented in the course is thoroughly explained.
Many of the ""basic concepts"" for Bash (and other modern shells) like e.g. function definitions, proper error handling, etc., are not even included in the course.
The importance of using correct quotations for variable/parameter expansions is also never mentioned nor explained, although it should be considered essential ""best practice"".
Peer-graded Final Assignment instructions/""guide"" contains some errors and not fully tested solutions, advertised as ""working correctly"".
The similar can be said about grading rubrics for the final assignment - which additionally are not focused on the actual results of the code execution, but instead they're focused on the code ""looks"", as in its visual resemblance (being as close to ""identical"" as possible) to what the course's staff have written in the grading rubrics.
In some cases, if the teaching staff finds a question in a discussion forum a bit more ""inconvenient"" for them to answer (or they're not fully capable of providing the correct answer to it in a timely manner?), then they would rather:
a) ignore the question completely (the least they can do is to not get involved at all) or reply with something similar to: ""we'll investigate the issue and get back to you"" (the latter ""get back to you"" almost never happens for a ""more complicated"" question);
b) reply with some irrelevant, impractical, incorrect, or otherwise unuseful information;
c) politely ask, to not bring the subject up ever again, as it may ""overwhelm the learners"";
d) delete the post (most often containing a valid, correct answer to the question) from discussion forums (I see censorship as ""means of hiding incompetence""?)
e) repeat other learner's correct answer (sometimes only slightly modifying it);
f) use and completely rely on AI LLM (e.g. ChatGPT, Bard, or other) and answers provided by it (which are mostly ridiculous), without even basic output verification; 
g) and also (occasionally) delete any relevant corrections (made by more knowledgeable learners) to previous staff's posts/replies;
than admit to any mistakes in the course contents, admit to lack of expertise in the subject matter, and address the questions properly - e.g. by allowing open discussion on potential improvements to the course materials, and implementing all said improvements as soon as possible (after reviewing).
These practices have been reported, and as I was assured by the Coursera Support Team, this kind of inappropriate teaching staff's behaviors will be escalated further, so I'm awaiting next developments of the situation.
But I still think this kind of inappropriate behaviors are a clear example, of what gives (or rather should give) the Skill-Up Technologies Pvt. Ltd. / SkillUp Online (employers for the most of ""teaching staff"") a bad reputation.
This also might give Coursera courses and IBM Skills Network a really bad publicity in a long-run.
Teaching and following ""best practices"", and answering doubts with relevant, thorough, technical knowledge in the discussion forums of this course... is something you unlikely/rarely find coming from the teaching staff.
Generally, teaching staff don't seem to be fit for the job of thoroughly explaining the course materials and teaching the proper ""understanding"" of your mistakes (as hard as they try to be seen ""cooperative""),
but as I see it, they're better suited for
a) only requesting you to ""copy and paste"" their code samples, that they believe should work best as a ""correct solution"" in their opinions (side note, again, ""my opinion"" - their code doesn't work all that great, and is not written with all the ""best practices"" in mind) and 
b) deleting ""inconvenient"" posts from the discussion forums whenever they please.
To sum it up: in its current form, and with its current teaching staff replying in the discussion forums, I'd definitely not recommend this course to anyone, especially beginners. And I'd discourage seeking any ""great"" learning experience from Skill-Up Technologies Pvt. Ltd. / SkillUp Online - thus I'd strongly suggest searching for some other, better resources on the subjects regarding basics of working with Linux CLI and shell scripting.

Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Murilo S,"Jan 14, 2024","I have completed several courses as part of the IBM Data Engineering Professional Certificate, and most of them have been exceptional in terms of content and coherence. However, I must express my disappointment with a particular course in the series.
The course content seemed incomplete, lacking the depth and breadth that I have come to expect from IBM courses. This made it difficult to gain a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.",2

Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Ryan S,"Dec 27, 2021","Good overview, but should have included more using BASH scripts. Conditional statements and loops were not covered. Functions were not covered. Could have included catching errors with ""$?"".  Running a database command  in a BASH script to import or export data would be useful. Still a decent course though.",4
Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Volkert d V,"Jan 19, 2024","I have a few qualms on this still good, dense course: (1) - there is a lot of jargon that is taken for granted. For someone new to programming - you can easily get lost - especially when certain programs are only mentioned once and then taken to be known (e.g. Kubernetes, RedHat etc.) A cheat sheet would be very welcome. (2) the videos, while clear, are very dense, and the voice is very mono-tone which became quite a turn-down. To make sure students capture it it would be helpful to have more cross-checking questions during the lecture. (3) the final peer reviewed exercise is tricky and the peer review system doesn't work that great. with all the talk on automated checking in IBMs DevOps course I would think an automated check would be more effective - and could actually point out to you what you did wrong. for example - I had trouble figuring out a certain line of code and I actually asked chatGPT - turns out I had one space too much. in another case I came up with a slightly different code which did the same job. My peer reviewer rated it wrong.",3

Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Muhammad H,"Apr 2, 2023","Overall, the course is very nicely designed and implemented except for the last week where they have shell scripting assignment.

Introductory Human Physiology,By Kin I R N,"Apr 16, 2018",I am an incoming medical student here in the Philippines and this course has provided me with enough background about the human body and the underlying machinery of every system associated with it. ,5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Maxine P M,"Jun 28, 2020","The primary reason for enrolling in the course was to enhance my knowledge base of human physiology. Although it has been many decades since I've taken anatomy and physiology as well as pathophysiology, I have taught it twice at the secondary level.  Upon reviewing the description of the course, it indicated that it was introductory, but knowledge of biology/science would be helpful, I thought it might be a great refresher course.  I beg to differ! This course WAS NOT introductory.  Let me give you the positives first: pdf's and readings were extremely helpful.  The negatives, the instructors were not impressive. One instructor talked absolutely too fast and much too often wouldn't complete the sentences OR she would repeat words or phrases that didn't make sense. I found it difficult to grasp the lecture when this instructor couldn't get through a sentence without stumbling over her thoughts, mumbling, trailing off and not finishing her sentence, etc. More often than not, the information provided in the lecture was inconsistent with the notes/pdf's. One other thing, she constantly smacked her mouth which was nerve-wrecking!  During the lectures, she would write on the powerpoints, which was either sloppy or not legible. After the fifth week, I honestly wanted to withdraw from the course, but decided to finish it out solely because it was half way completed and the time that had already been invested.  Many viewers gave the course 5 stars, I could not.  Although I completed the course with a 93.4% grade, the level of information was extensive, to some degree over the top.  The course needs to be restructured so that it stays within the context of an introductory course.  In my opinion, this course is more suitable for a first-second year medical student.  BTW, this is the sixth course that I have completed through Coursera, including a specialization.  Good luck!",2
Introductory Human Physiology,By Jade D,"Jan 5, 2021","Best course I've ever taken!  Detailed and thorough explanations of the systems of the body.  Fascinating, enlightening, and enjoyable.  Highly recommend for anyone interested in how the body functions.",5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Sylvia Q,"Jan 18, 2020","Great class - very dense, like drinking from a fire hose, but wow I learned a lot! I took this just because I wanted to learn more about how the body magically does what it does, every day, without me thinking about it. I had no prior experience in physiology or anatomy, so this required me to do a LOT of note-taking and a little bit of Googling on the side for further understanding. If a week's videos totaled 2 hours, I spent about 4-5 getting through them and taking notes. I should add that I did not use the forums regularly, but I saw that many students had, and that their questions were answered fairly promptly, often by Emma Jakoi herself. The end-of-unit quizzes always included questions which forced you to apply your new learning to cases, and these could be challenging! Thanks to Duke for making this great class available online for free.",5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Dave H,"Oct 11, 2016",I gained a deeper understanding and greater appreciation for how my body works.  Thank you to the Teams at Duke and Coursera for making such a wide body of information available to the motivated. ,5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Joshua S,"Dec 9, 2019"," It is so hard to learn from a professor who can't get through 2  sentences without stumbling over her thoughts, mumbling, trailing off  and not finishing her sentence, etc. Perhaps if she spent less time  pretending to be John Madden with her little board, she could focus on  being an effective orator. Perhaps the second professor would have been better, but after 2 hours of listening to Dr. Jakoi, I now have to contact Coursera to see if I can get a refund or switch courses.",1
Introductory Human Physiology,By Anastasiia N,"Oct 24, 2015","The effect of this course in understanding the body physiology and understanding the terminology of other courses can be compared to learning to read. Now I can take other, more specialized courses without having to Google every other word and actually understand the processes they're talking about instead of simply memorizing them. ",5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Dustin J,"Aug 23, 2020","I'm a college freshman (majoring in nursing) and I took this course due to the pandemic. I found this course challenging since it focuses more on the physiology of the human body in more detail than a regular my anatomy and physiology class back in high school. This course isn't really an ""introductory"" course, you may need some background on science courses like chemistry, biology, anatomy, and physiology (So keep that in mind if you want to enroll). I have a limited background in science these courses (Biology, chemistry, etc) and finished this course, and yes it is possible to finish this course without knowing all about science stuff, it just took a little more effort to quickly learn science terms and stuff. With all of that, the course was great and for a nursing major like me really helped me developed surface-level knowledge about the function of the human body. Lectures are good, a little fast for me but they provide great PDF that I can refer to. Practice quizzes did help me a lot, but I hope that they provide feedback or explanation on why I got it wrong instead of just showing ""correct"" or ""incorrect"". It's worth my time learning physiology and I highly recommend it! Big thanks to the instructors and staff, especially Coursera for making this course free to the public!",5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Karen J,"May 10, 2020","Definitely, this is not an introductory course. Actually, you need some prior background in physiology, biology, chemistry, anatomy before taking it. It is also very challenging!  ",5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Ariane M,"Nov 4, 2017",Very very interesting but also very challenging. I would not say this is a beginner's physiology course. Very much worth doing if you are interested in the medical field of some sort. ,4
Introductory Human Physiology,By Lucie P,"Jul 26, 2016","This course seems to require a high level of foundation knowledge that I don't have.

It helps me to gain better knowledge and information to what happens to our body in response to all those external influences of stress, intake of food and liquid.  All the lectures are very professionally conducted with clear notes in the resources.  Many times, video lectures provided very good external cases beyond the texts.  I must also respect that both of you continue with the lectures despite hearing coughing many times throughout.  Great professionalism demonstrated, even in such coursera.co course.",5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Christine A,"Apr 20, 2020","This course is excellent, if physiology is something you need for your career/personal interest. Mimi Jakoi and  Jennifer Carbrey are magnificent in their field, and they both provide their tremendous insight to a high-functioning foundation level for the subject. However, if you are someone like me, a middle school science teacher who was only looking to find a novice level of physiology, you are going to get above and beyond what you imagined. I would definitely recommend this course to those who are highly invested in the subject, as it provides a great breadth of detail to 10 human systems. ",5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Parvathy s n,"May 28, 2022",it was a fun ride to be a part of this journey of learning  HUMAN PHYSIOLOGY .....it was very much helpful for understanding the basic concepts of our body how our body functions internally as well their hormonal capabilities. i feel really confident now because the lecture was easy to understand i thoroughly enjoyed. thank you. ,5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Pei-Hsuan L,"Jun 12, 2020","I don't speak for everyone, but this course was relatively difficult for an introductory course. It required an adequate amount of base/foundation on the subject in order for one to understand what the lesson is talking about. ",3

Introductory Human Physiology,By Bryony R,"Feb 10, 2019",I am about to start a degree in nursing and this was an excellent introduction.  The pace was quite fast and the content is quite technical but through rereading the materials and watching some supplementary explanations (such as Khan academy) it all made sense.

Introductory Human Physiology,By Calista L,"Oct 8, 2020","Great things first: It’s a great course, with quite an
amount of information each video each module. For each week’s two to three
video hours, I spent 5 to 6 hours researching through googling or textbook
reading, and an intense note-taking all along. I highly recommend anyone who
wants a ‘warm-up’ in college physiology to do this course. This is perhaps a
first college level physiology, but it’s no way ‘introductory’. For a student with
mostly humanities background like me, it’s going to be a challenging course.
But it is really worth doing.",5

First Step Korean,By Mailine Y,"Oct 25, 2019","This class was very hard to follow. Pronunciation is key to any language. This course does not help you become even close to basic proficiency because there is no pronunciation key available. The worksheets are so hard to follow because it's all in Hangul with no pronunciation key or english pronunciation available. For a beginner course, this should have been standard- we don't know how to read Hangul and it shouldn't be expected during a beginners course. This course has a lot of room for improvement and would be great once they are implemented to become more user friendly. Also, rather than just using Hangul and English words in the videos, there should be pronunciation underneath the Hangul to make sure students are really getting the words correct instead of them trying to figure out word it is and referring to worksheets all the time. I did not have a good time learning the language because it was so frustrating trying to figure out what she was saying exactly- thus making the quizzes even more difficult!!",2
First Step Korean,By Lynne,"Dec 16, 2016",It was very well organised and presented. There was good opportunity for repetition in the videos and good opportunity to study the main written expressions and grammar in the PDF files. Excellent!,5

First Step Korean,By LeapingFrog E,"Nov 17, 2016","Although the instructor was good at presenting the information, I felt that the reference sheets should of had the phonetic pronunciations next to the Korean writing.

I did still learn a great deal of vocabulary.",3

First Step Korean,By jenn (,"Nov 30, 2018","This is the first online course where I can begin to understand how to put sentence structure together and begin to understand honorifics. I do think that you have to come into this course with an understanding of the Korean alphabet and basic knowledge of how to compose and read letters. Once you have that down, this course definitely helps you begin to move forward in becoming fluent with verbal and written comprehension. You definitely have to practice and repeat your practice consistently to retain your new knowledge. I love this course. Thank you!",5
First Step Korean,By Büşra G,"Oct 17, 2017",I wish there was korean subtitles instead of [FOREIGN] .,3
First Step Korean,By Kathy C,"Feb 15, 2017","This was a good course, but much more ambitious than the description or name suggests.  I had to watch the videos at 75% speed in order to figure out what was actually said, as I have never heard any Korean before.  I used the quizlet flashcards and some youtube videos in order to learn the material, as the ""lecture notes"" were not always very helpful.  So in all, a good course if you can access some supplementary activities.  In fact, adding the quizlet flashcards to the lesson either before the lecture or before the quiz would be helpful for future students.  I plan to take the class again in order to master the material.",3

Financial Markets,By Deleted A,"Apr 23, 2019","This course is virtually worthless. I couldn't follow the lectures, and I have a PhD and have been a tenured professor for almost two decades. The online course is based on snippets taken from face-to-face lectures and breakout sessions, and the result is utter incoherence. The instructor frequently refers to concepts that have not yet been encountered in the online version of the course; makes extensive use of mathematical notations and formulas whose variables are never properly explained; and generally does a poor job of explaining the material. This online version of the Yale course was obviously slapped together with very little thought and production value; it's one of those unsuccessful attempts to bring in revenue on the cheap, creating an online version out of existing face-to-face material, rather than building a real online course from scratch. This was wasted money and time. This attempt to capitalize on the Yale brand is pathetic.    ",1
Financial Markets,By Sanam P,"Oct 23, 2017","This course was horrible! The Content was very disoriented and unclear. Videos were distorted, and jumping from one topic to another. There was no sense of continuity. One can not say this was a course from Yale...",1

Financial Markets,By Tiyash B,"May 3, 2018","A great introductory level course which is recommended for anyone with a remote interest in finance irrespective of whether they have a background in finance or economics. The strongest point of this course is the simplicity with which it conveys the importance and relevance of finance in today's world. The instructor and his team have taken great care to introduce topics in a manner simple enough for anyone to understand. While the course content may not go very in-depth into how a particular stock market works, or how particular stocks move, it provides great insight into why the stock market is necessary and relevant in our current society and how human behavior and its expression through policy and law can result in both financial progress and also crisis.

Financial Markets,By Doan T L ,"May 26, 2019","It’s a good online course in Finance that I have never learned before. I have gained the basic knowledge of financial markets and their applications in reality. Absolutely right, finance is not just about making money that I thought before joining in this course, and as a popular opinion as well, it is more than that, it has much more meaningful. This course has brought to me the necessary skills to make more rational decisions in my life, in my future career, I think. It’s also helped me to realize how I should work in this sector to serve the right purposes, to make the people living around me to be better. And it’s true that educational finance is very important to everyone. Professor Robert Shiller is an amazing teacher, many thanks to Professor Robert Shiller and Yale’s Financial Markets Course team. I highly recommend taking this course! ",5
Financial Markets,By Stefano E,"Mar 17, 2019","Probably the best financial market course on coursera. Intense and very rich in content. Too much,  though.

Financial Markets,By Anthony S,"Jan 10, 2019","Some parts of the course were informative.  Some were disappointing.  Replaying it in my mind now that I'm done, I feel that the course dwelt on the flaws of financial markets, rather than being an explanation of their workings.  It was an indictment of markets more than I would have expected, instead of being instructive toward them.  There was a section toward the end on ""critics of finance"".  Far less effort was made in defense of modern finance (a wonderful field).",3
Financial Markets,By Maumau B,"Jun 30, 2019","You can never get bored with Professor Shiller. He is very passionate about how things work or how to make it happen, and will convince you that everything in life needed finance. He likes history and is a lifelong learner. I rated 5 stars because he made it simple for people to learn regardless of ages or education. ",5
Business Analysis & Process Management,By Thomas G,"Dec 15, 2020","""Pause and look at this doc ok welcome back now pause and do it yourself ok you now know how to write a business plan"". The instructor simply read a script verbatim with no punctuation, pauses, or personality. The whole thing was incredibly rushed, and ""rushed"" is not the same thing as ""fast paced"". Absolutely no justification for using the clunky Rhyme virtual desktop, as all you do is open a Google Doc and make a Lucid Chart account. Why would I log into my email and set up another account in your virtual desktop?",1
Business Analysis & Process Management,By Gisela W,"Dec 19, 2020","I like the hands-on platform and the approach of following along with the instructor side by side. However, the instructor speaks way too fast. I lowered the speed to 0.7 and was still struggling to follow. Also, at times the questions/instructions are not 100% clear or confusing so that I wasn't sure what to do and just kept watching. The content is quite superficial. The project does give you some guidance in modeling a simple business process using Lucidchart which I appreciate.",2
Business Analysis & Process Management,By Deleted A,"Feb 11, 2021","Coursera please remove this course!

Anyway, I'm so disappointed with IBM and this course. ",1
"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Julian L G,"Jan 4, 2019","It is amazing how bad this is considering that it is marketed as an IBM product. This is not the level of quality people expect when they hear the name IBM! You'd be better off paying 9.99 for a Udemy course than taking this course. It is not in depth at all and does a stunningly poor job at building real understanding and competency. The videos and labs are full of sloppiness and errors... again, not living up to the IBM name. I don't know about y'all, but I'm probably never going to pay money for a coursera course again... not really worth it.",1

"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Aykut Ö,"Mar 4, 2019","  As in the other parts of the certificate, the tasks are simply too easy. The content in the videos (many typos!!!!) are really valuable but the tasks man... Only the surface of the surface will be discussed, no deeping down into the wild. In this course the libraries numpy and pandas are presented but in the final assignment we actually don't needed the libs... When I read the description of the final assignment, I was excited because I assumed we will need to code EVERYTHING ourselves. So really do the thinking of how to solve the requirements, testing it in a notebook out, reading the docs, discovering new cool stuff... But unfortunately my dream did not come true. The most exciting function was already provided and some of the answers were little bit of copy and paste instead of really recalling newly learned knowledge. Before this review I really wanted to give 4 out of 5 stars but after writing this review I will now give only 2 stars. Actually, 2 stars are in my opinion unfair, since the creators have put a lot of time and love in the course content. Unfortunately, so much potential is thrown away  ",2

"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Steve O,"Oct 31, 2018","The IBM cloud ""service"" leaves much to be desired.

I spend many hours on a number of evenings figuring what was meant. If this lead to constructive learning, I'd be OK with it.

Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Basil K,"May 18, 2022","There is so much information missing in the labs in this course esp starting from Week 3. The videos it seems like were put together in a hurry with crucial information missing and labs are even worse than the videos. They are expecting one to find, set, unset files in extremely long scripts without providing any information on how it is done. Furthermore, there is little to no information given on why certain commands are called what they are called making this course not at all intuitive. I wish someone else has reviewed this course before putting it online. Such a wasted opportunity to educate people. ",1

I feel like I learned almost nothing!",1
Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Mateusz K,"Jan 24, 2024","Everything that follows, is just my own personal opinion, if not stated otherwise. It is based on my observations and interactions with teaching staff in the course discussion forums (for the last few months).
This is a very poorly executed course.
As of today (23 Jan 2024) this course for me still does not meet the criteria of a ""good resource for learning"" the basics of Linux CLI and shell scripting (despite few minor improvements already applied).
Some of the topics are hastily skimmed through in the videos, and almost no mechanism presented in the course is thoroughly explained.
Many of the ""basic concepts"" for Bash (and other modern shells) like e.g. function definitions, proper error handling, etc., are not even included in the course.
The importance of using correct quotations for variable/parameter expansions is also never mentioned nor explained, although it should be considered essential ""best practice"".
Peer-graded Final Assignment instructions/""guide"" contains some errors and not fully tested solutions, advertised as ""working correctly"".
The similar can be said about grading rubrics for the final assignment - which additionally are not focused on the actual results of the code execution, but instead they're focused on the code ""looks"", as in its visual resemblance (being as close to ""identical"" as possible) to what the course's staff have written in the grading rubrics.
In some cases, if the teaching staff finds a question in a discussion forum a bit more ""inconvenient"" for them to answer (or they're not fully capable of providing the correct answer to it in a timely manner?), then they would rather:
a) ignore the question completely (the least they can do is to not get involved at all) or reply with something similar to: ""we'll investigate the issue and get back to you"" (the latter ""get back to you"" almost never happens for a ""more complicated"" question);
b) reply with some irrelevant, impractical, incorrect, or otherwise unuseful information;
c) politely ask, to not bring the subject up ever again, as it may ""overwhelm the learners"";
d) delete the post (most often containing a valid, correct answer to the question) from discussion forums (I see censorship as ""means of hiding incompetence""?)
e) repeat other learner's correct answer (sometimes only slightly modifying it);
f) use and completely rely on AI LLM (e.g. ChatGPT, Bard, or other) and answers provided by it (which are mostly ridiculous), without even basic output verification; 
g) and also (occasionally) delete any relevant corrections (made by more knowledgeable learners) to previous staff's posts/replies;
than admit to any mistakes in the course contents, admit to lack of expertise in the subject matter, and address the questions properly - e.g. by allowing open discussion on potential improvements to the course materials, and implementing all said improvements as soon as possible (after reviewing).
These practices have been reported, and as I was assured by the Coursera Support Team, this kind of inappropriate teaching staff's behaviors will be escalated further, so I'm awaiting next developments of the situation.
But I still think this kind of inappropriate behaviors are a clear example, of what gives (or rather should give) the Skill-Up Technologies Pvt. Ltd. / SkillUp Online (employers for the most of ""teaching staff"") a bad reputation.
This also might give Coursera courses and IBM Skills Network a really bad publicity in a long-run.
Teaching and following ""best practices"", and answering doubts with relevant, thorough, technical knowledge in the discussion forums of this course... is something you unlikely/rarely find coming from the teaching staff.
Generally, teaching staff don't seem to be fit for the job of thoroughly explaining the course materials and teaching the proper ""understanding"" of your mistakes (as hard as they try to be seen ""cooperative""),
but as I see it, they're better suited for
a) only requesting you to ""copy and paste"" their code samples, that they believe should work best as a ""correct solution"" in their opinions (side note, again, ""my opinion"" - their code doesn't work all that great, and is not written with all the ""best practices"" in mind) and 
b) deleting ""inconvenient"" posts from the discussion forums whenever they please.
To sum it up: in its current form, and with its current teaching staff replying in the discussion forums, I'd definitely not recommend this course to anyone, especially beginners. And I'd discourage seeking any ""great"" learning experience from Skill-Up Technologies Pvt. Ltd. / SkillUp Online - thus I'd strongly suggest searching for some other, better resources on the subjects regarding basics of working with Linux CLI and shell scripting.

Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Volkert d V,"Jan 19, 2024","I have a few qualms on this still good, dense course: (1) - there is a lot of jargon that is taken for granted. For someone new to programming - you can easily get lost - especially when certain programs are only mentioned once and then taken to be known (e.g. Kubernetes, RedHat etc.) A cheat sheet would be very welcome. (2) the videos, while clear, are very dense, and the voice is very mono-tone which became quite a turn-down. To make sure students capture it it would be helpful to have more cross-checking questions during the lecture. (3) the final peer reviewed exercise is tricky and the peer review system doesn't work that great. with all the talk on automated checking in IBMs DevOps course I would think an automated check would be more effective - and could actually point out to you what you did wrong. for example - I had trouble figuring out a certain line of code and I actually asked chatGPT - turns out I had one space too much. in another case I came up with a slightly different code which did the same job.

One instructor talked absolutely too fast and much too often wouldn't complete the sentences OR she would repeat words or phrases that didn't make sense. I found it difficult to grasp the lecture when this instructor couldn't get through a sentence without stumbling over her thoughts, mumbling, trailing off and not finishing her sentence, etc. More often than not, the information provided in the lecture was inconsistent with the notes/pdf's. One other thing, she constantly smacked her mouth which was nerve-wrecking!  During the lectures, she would write on the powerpoints, which was either sloppy or not legible. After the fifth week, I honestly wanted to withdraw from the course, but decided to finish it out solely because it was half way completed and the time that had already been invested.  Many viewers gave the course 5 stars, I could not.  Although I completed the course with a 93.4% grade, the level of information was extensive, to some degree over the top.  The course needs to be restructured so that it stays within the context of an introductory course.  In my opinion, this course is more suitable for a first-second year medical student.  BTW, this is the sixth course that I have completed through Coursera, including a specialization.  Good luck!",2
Introductory Human Physiology,By Jade D,"Jan 5, 2021","Best course I've ever taken!  Detailed and thorough explanations of the systems of the body.  Fascinating, enlightening, and enjoyable.  Highly recommend for anyone interested in how the body functions.",5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Sylvia Q,"Jan 18, 2020","Great class - very dense, like drinking from a fire hose, but wow I learned a lot! I took this just because I wanted to learn more about how the body magically does what it does, every day, without me thinking about it. I had no prior experience in physiology or anatomy, so this required me to do a LOT of note-taking and a little bit of Googling on the side for further understanding. If a week's videos totaled 2 hours, I spent about 4-5 getting through them and taking notes. I should add that I did not use the forums regularly, but I saw that many students had, and that their questions were answered fairly promptly, often by Emma Jakoi herself. The end-of-unit quizzes always included questions which forced you to apply your new learning to cases, and these could be challenging! Thanks to Duke for making this great class available online for free.",5

Introductory Human Physiology,By Joshua S,"Dec 9, 2019"," It is so hard to learn from a professor who can't get through 2  sentences without stumbling over her thoughts, mumbling, trailing off  and not finishing her sentence, etc. Perhaps if she spent less time  pretending to be John Madden with her little board, she could focus on  being an effective orator. Perhaps the second professor would have been better, but after 2 hours of listening to Dr. Jakoi, I now have to contact Coursera to see if I can get a refund or switch courses.",1
Introductory Human Physiology,By Anastasiia N,"Oct 24, 2015","The effect of this course in understanding the body physiology and understanding the terminology of other courses can be compared to learning to read. Now I can take other, more specialized courses without having to Google every other word and actually understand the processes they're talking about instead of simply memorizing them. ",5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Dustin J,"Aug 23, 2020","I'm a college freshman (majoring in nursing) and I took this course due to the pandemic. I found this course challenging since it focuses more on the physiology of the human body in more detail than a regular my anatomy and physiology class back in high school. This course isn't really an ""introductory"" course, you may need some background on science courses like chemistry, biology, anatomy, and physiology (So keep that in mind if you want to enroll). I have a limited background in science these courses (Biology, chemistry, etc) and finished this course, and yes it is possible to finish this course without knowing all about science stuff, it just took a little more effort to quickly learn science terms and stuff. With all of that, the course was great and for a nursing major like me really helped me developed surface-level knowledge about the function of the human body. Lectures are good, a little fast for me but they provide great PDF that I can refer to. Practice quizzes did help me a lot, but I hope that they provide feedback or explanation on why I got it wrong instead of just showing ""correct"" or ""incorrect"". It's worth my time learning physiology and I highly recommend it! Big thanks to the instructors and staff, especially Coursera for making this course free to the public!",5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Karen J,"May 10, 2020","Definitely, this is not an introductory course. Actually, you need some prior background in physiology, biology, chemistry, anatomy before taking it. It is also very challenging!  ",5

It helps me to gain better knowledge and information to what happens to our body in response to all those external influences of stress, intake of food and liquid.  All the lectures are very professionally conducted with clear notes in the resources.  Many times, video lectures provided very good external cases beyond the texts.  I must also respect that both of you continue with the lectures despite hearing coughing many times throughout.  Great professionalism demonstrated, even in such coursera.co course.",5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Christine A,"Apr 20, 2020","This course is excellent, if physiology is something you need for your career/personal interest. Mimi Jakoi and  Jennifer Carbrey are magnificent in their field, and they both provide their tremendous insight to a high-functioning foundation level for the subject. However, if you are someone like me, a middle school science teacher who was only looking to find a novice level of physiology, you are going to get above and beyond what you imagined. I would definitely recommend this course to those who are highly invested in the subject, as it provides a great breadth of detail to 10 human systems. ",5

Introductory Human Physiology,By Calista L,"Oct 8, 2020","Great things first: It’s a great course, with quite an
amount of information each video each module. For each week’s two to three
video hours, I spent 5 to 6 hours researching through googling or textbook
reading, and an intense note-taking all along. I highly recommend anyone who
wants a ‘warm-up’ in college physiology to do this course. This is perhaps a
first college level physiology, but it’s no way ‘introductory’. For a student with
mostly humanities background like me, it’s going to be a challenging course.
But it is really worth doing.",5

First Step Korean,By Mailine Y,"Oct 25, 2019","This class was very hard to follow. Pronunciation is key to any language. This course does not help you become even close to basic proficiency because there is no pronunciation key available. The worksheets are so hard to follow because it's all in Hangul with no pronunciation key or english pronunciation available. For a beginner course, this should have been standard- we don't know how to read Hangul and it shouldn't be expected during a beginners course. This course has a lot of room for improvement and would be great once they are implemented to become more user friendly. Also, rather than just using Hangul and English words in the videos, there should be pronunciation underneath the Hangul to make sure students are really getting the words correct instead of them trying to figure out word it is and referring to worksheets all the time. I did not have a good time learning the language because it was so frustrating trying to figure out what she was saying exactly- thus making the quizzes even more difficult!!",2

I did still learn a great deal of vocabulary.",3

I do think that you have to come into this course with an understanding of the Korean alphabet and basic knowledge of how to compose and read letters. Once you have that down, this course definitely helps you begin to move forward in becoming fluent with verbal and written comprehension. You definitely have to practice and repeat your practice consistently to retain your new knowledge. I love this course. Thank you!",5

First Step Korean,By Kathy C,"Feb 15, 2017","This was a good course, but much more ambitious than the description or name suggests.  I had to watch the videos at 75% speed in order to figure out what was actually said, as I have never heard any Korean before.  I used the quizlet flashcards and some youtube videos in order to learn the material, as the ""lecture notes"" were not always very helpful.  So in all, a good course if you can access some supplementary activities.  In fact, adding the quizlet flashcards to the lesson either before the lecture or before the quiz would be helpful for future students.  I plan to take the class again in order to master the material.",3

Financial Markets,By Deleted A,"Apr 23, 2019","This course is virtually worthless. I couldn't follow the lectures, and I have a PhD and have been a tenured professor for almost two decades. The online course is based on snippets taken from face-to-face lectures and breakout sessions, and the result is utter incoherence. The instructor frequently refers to concepts that have not yet been encountered in the online version of the course; makes extensive use of mathematical notations and formulas whose variables are never properly explained; and generally does a poor job of explaining the material. This online version of the Yale course was obviously slapped together with very little thought and production value; it's one of those unsuccessful attempts to bring in revenue on the cheap, creating an online version out of existing face-to-face material, rather than building a real online course from scratch. This was wasted money and time. This attempt to capitalize on the Yale brand is pathetic.    ",1

The strongest point of this course is the simplicity with which it conveys the importance and relevance of finance in today's world. The instructor and his team have taken great care to introduce topics in a manner simple enough for anyone to understand. While the course content may not go very in-depth into how a particular stock market works, or how particular stocks move, it provides great insight into why the stock market is necessary and relevant in our current society and how human behavior and its expression through policy and law can result in both financial progress and also crisis.

Absolutely right, finance is not just about making money that I thought before joining in this course, and as a popular opinion as well, it is more than that, it has much more meaningful. This course has brought to me the necessary skills to make more rational decisions in my life, in my future career, I think. It’s also helped me to realize how I should work in this sector to serve the right purposes, to make the people living around me to be better. And it’s true that educational finance is very important to everyone. Professor Robert Shiller is an amazing teacher, many thanks to Professor Robert Shiller and Yale’s Financial Markets Course team.

Financial Markets,By Anthony S,"Jan 10, 2019","Some parts of the course were informative.  Some were disappointing.  Replaying it in my mind now that I'm done, I feel that the course dwelt on the flaws of financial markets, rather than being an explanation of their workings.  It was an indictment of markets more than I would have expected, instead of being instructive toward them.  There was a section toward the end on ""critics of finance"".  Far less effort was made in defense of modern finance (a wonderful field).",3

Anyway, I'm so disappointed with IBM and this course. ",1
"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Julian L G,"Jan 4, 2019","It is amazing how bad this is considering that it is marketed as an IBM product. This is not the level of quality people expect when they hear the name IBM! You'd be better off paying 9.99 for a Udemy course than taking this course. It is not in depth at all and does a stunningly poor job at building real understanding and competency. The videos and labs are full of sloppiness and errors... again, not living up to the IBM name. I don't know about y'all, but I'm probably never going to pay money for a coursera course again... not really worth it.",1
"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Robert I,"May 10, 2019","I had a lot of problems with the Peer Assignment, which had nothing to do with Python Programming. The Watson environment has changed a lot compared to the learning materials.",1
"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By William B L,"Mar 15, 2019","Every course has offered something interesting, challenging, and surprising.  I am glad I have spent the time with this class.  I would strongly recommend it to others with an interest in data science.",5
"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Aykut Ö,"Mar 4, 2019","  As in the other parts of the certificate, the tasks are simply too easy. The content in the videos (many typos!!!!) are really valuable but the tasks man... Only the surface of the surface will be discussed, no deeping down into the wild. In this course the libraries numpy and pandas are presented but in the final assignment we actually don't needed the libs... When I read the description of the final assignment, I was excited because I assumed we will need to code EVERYTHING ourselves. So really do the thinking of how to solve the requirements, testing it in a notebook out, reading the docs, discovering new cool stuff... But unfortunately my dream did not come true. The most exciting function was already provided and some of the answers were little bit of copy and paste instead of really recalling newly learned knowledge. Before this review I really wanted to give 4 out of 5 stars but after writing this review I will now give only 2 stars. Actually, 2 stars are in my opinion unfair, since the creators have put a lot of time and love in the course content. Unfortunately, so much potential is thrown away  ",2
"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Asim I,"May 21, 2019", (5 stars):  Course was great!!  ,1
"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Declan H M G,"May 22, 2019","The course content is good. However, the instructions for the final peer graded assignment are unclear. It appears to me that we were graded on our ability to interact with IBM cloud and Watson service not so much python skills also. Although I completed, I would not recommend to other until changes are made. It seems I'm not the only one that is unhappy or who had difficulties, just look at the week 5 discussion forum!",1
"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Jennifer P,"Dec 27, 2018","This class was supposed to be for beginners and most of the information in the videos was easy to digest, however, the final project had elements and questions that were never covered. Also, there were many, many spelling and context errors in the videos and quizzes. This lead to a tremendous amount of confusion and I am not happy with this course or my grade. Please consider reviewing the lessons and final project to cater this course more to beginners.",1
"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Steve O,"Oct 31, 2018","The IBM cloud ""service"" leaves much to be desired. Multiple times I've experienced outages while I was in the middle of lab assignments. It's a paid course where they give you ""free"" credits to do the course work in their cloud ""service."" But the credits are inadequate for the labs and they constantly ask for your credit card to buy more ""service."" While the class is okay I wouldn't recommend it to anyone because of the poor IBM cloud support.",1

"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Arjan Z,"May 23, 2019","the final assignment was extremely poorly set-up. Instructions were full of gaps, omissions, spelling mistakes. Looked like it was written by a deep-expert who assumed a lot of knowledge that you do not have at this entry level and that was nowhere made explicit. I spend many hours on a number of evenings figuring what was meant. If this lead to constructive learning, I'd be OK with it. But now it was just a long egg-hunt to figure out how I was to post something using idiosyncratic IBM infrastructure which taught me little about Python. Was this course even test driven?",1
"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Simon O,"Apr 20, 2019",Final test needs to be actually tested by instructors. Has a few bugs in it. You would learn more about python reading a book. ,1
"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Pranay C,"May 27, 2019","Very good course for people who do not know Python. It just starts with the basic and focuses on data structures which is essential for Data Science. Does not teach you any unessential Python syntax which will not be useful in this specialization course. If you know any programming language, you will get it (because Python is easier and simpler than the language you know :)",5

However, I found that the course only touched on the surface-level concepts and lacked in-depth analysis. The course content was quite basic and did not provide any new insights or knowledge that I was not already aware of. Overall, I was disappointed with the course and felt that it did not meet my expectations. I had expected the course to be more detailed, but unfortunately, I didn't gain much knowledge.

What would you put as the header for column A and column B (in that order)""  The order of the information provided says ""number of states for each sales person"" which would be option 4, ""No. of States, Salesperson"".

Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Basil K,"May 18, 2022","There is so much information missing in the labs in this course esp starting from Week 3. The videos it seems like were put together in a hurry with crucial information missing and labs are even worse than the videos. They are expecting one to find, set, unset files in extremely long scripts without providing any information on how it is done. Furthermore, there is little to no information given on why certain commands are called what they are called making this course not at all intuitive. I wish someone else has reviewed this course before putting it online. Such a wasted opportunity to educate people. ",1

I feel like I learned almost nothing!",1
Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Mateusz K,"Jan 24, 2024","Everything that follows, is just my own personal opinion, if not stated otherwise. It is based on my observations and interactions with teaching staff in the course discussion forums (for the last few months).
This is a very poorly executed course.
As of today (23 Jan 2024) this course for me still does not meet the criteria of a ""good resource for learning"" the basics of Linux CLI and shell scripting (despite few minor improvements already applied).
Some of the topics are hastily skimmed through in the videos, and almost no mechanism presented in the course is thoroughly explained.
Many of the ""basic concepts"" for Bash (and other modern shells) like e.g. function definitions, proper error handling, etc., are not even included in the course.
The importance of using correct quotations for variable/parameter expansions is also never mentioned nor explained, although it should be considered essential ""best practice"".
Peer-graded Final Assignment instructions/""guide"" contains some errors and not fully tested solutions, advertised as ""working correctly"".
The similar can be said about grading rubrics for the final assignment - which additionally are not focused on the actual results of the code execution, but instead they're focused on the code ""looks"", as in its visual resemblance (being as close to ""identical"" as possible) to what the course's staff have written in the grading rubrics.
In some cases, if the teaching staff finds a question in a discussion forum a bit more ""inconvenient"" for them to answer (or they're not fully capable of providing the correct answer to it in a timely manner?), then they would rather:
a) ignore the question completely (the least they can do is to not get involved at all) or reply with something similar to: ""we'll investigate the issue and get back to you"" (the latter ""get back to you"" almost never happens for a ""more complicated"" question);
b) reply with some irrelevant, impractical, incorrect, or otherwise unuseful information;
c) politely ask, to not bring the subject up ever again, as it may ""overwhelm the learners"";
d) delete the post (most often containing a valid, correct answer to the question) from discussion forums (I see censorship as ""means of hiding incompetence""?)
e) repeat other learner's correct answer (sometimes only slightly modifying it);
f) use and completely rely on AI LLM (e.g. ChatGPT, Bard, or other) and answers provided by it (which are mostly ridiculous), without even basic output verification; 
g) and also (occasionally) delete any relevant corrections (made by more knowledgeable learners) to previous staff's posts/replies;
than admit to any mistakes in the course contents, admit to lack of expertise in the subject matter, and address the questions properly - e.g. by allowing open discussion on potential improvements to the course materials, and implementing all said improvements as soon as possible (after reviewing).
These practices have been reported, and as I was assured by the Coursera Support Team, this kind of inappropriate teaching staff's behaviors will be escalated further, so I'm awaiting next developments of the situation.
But I still think this kind of inappropriate behaviors are a clear example, of what gives (or rather should give) the Skill-Up Technologies Pvt. Ltd. / SkillUp Online (employers for the most of ""teaching staff"") a bad reputation.
This also might give Coursera courses and IBM Skills Network a really bad publicity in a long-run.
Teaching and following ""best practices"", and answering doubts with relevant, thorough, technical knowledge in the discussion forums of this course... is something you unlikely/rarely find coming from the teaching staff.
Generally, teaching staff don't seem to be fit for the job of thoroughly explaining the course materials and teaching the proper ""understanding"" of your mistakes (as hard as they try to be seen ""cooperative""),
but as I see it, they're better suited for
a) only requesting you to ""copy and paste"" their code samples, that they believe should work best as a ""correct solution"" in their opinions (side note, again, ""my opinion"" - their code doesn't work all that great, and is not written with all the ""best practices"" in mind) and 
b) deleting ""inconvenient"" posts from the discussion forums whenever they please.
To sum it up: in its current form, and with its current teaching staff replying in the discussion forums, I'd definitely not recommend this course to anyone, especially beginners. And I'd discourage seeking any ""great"" learning experience from Skill-Up Technologies Pvt. Ltd. / SkillUp Online - thus I'd strongly suggest searching for some other, better resources on the subjects regarding basics of working with Linux CLI and shell scripting.

Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting,By Volkert d V,"Jan 19, 2024","I have a few qualms on this still good, dense course: (1) - there is a lot of jargon that is taken for granted. For someone new to programming - you can easily get lost - especially when certain programs are only mentioned once and then taken to be known (e.g. Kubernetes, RedHat etc.) A cheat sheet would be very welcome. (2) the videos, while clear, are very dense, and the voice is very mono-tone which became quite a turn-down. To make sure students capture it it would be helpful to have more cross-checking questions during the lecture. (3) the final peer reviewed exercise is tricky and the peer review system doesn't work that great. with all the talk on automated checking in IBMs DevOps course I would think an automated check would be more effective - and could actually point out to you what you did wrong. for example - I had trouble figuring out a certain line of code and I actually asked chatGPT - turns out I had one space too much. in another case I came up with a slightly different code which did the same job.

Introductory Human Physiology,By Maxine P M,"Jun 28, 2020","The primary reason for enrolling in the course was to enhance my knowledge base of human physiology. Although it has been many decades since I've taken anatomy and physiology as well as pathophysiology, I have taught it twice at the secondary level.  Upon reviewing the description of the course, it indicated that it was introductory, but knowledge of biology/science would be helpful, I thought it might be a great refresher course.  I beg to differ! This course WAS NOT introductory.  Let me give you the positives first: pdf's and readings were extremely helpful.  The negatives, the instructors were not impressive. One instructor talked absolutely too fast and much too often wouldn't complete the sentences OR she would repeat words or phrases that didn't make sense. I found it difficult to grasp the lecture when this instructor couldn't get through a sentence without stumbling over her thoughts, mumbling, trailing off and not finishing her sentence, etc. More often than not, the information provided in the lecture was inconsistent with the notes/pdf's. One other thing, she constantly smacked her mouth which was nerve-wrecking!  During the lectures, she would write on the powerpoints, which was either sloppy or not legible. After the fifth week, I honestly wanted to withdraw from the course, but decided to finish it out solely because it was half way completed and the time that had already been invested.  Many viewers gave the course 5 stars, I could not.  Although I completed the course with a 93.4% grade, the level of information was extensive, to some degree over the top.  The course needs to be restructured so that it stays within the context of an introductory course.  In my opinion, this course is more suitable for a first-second year medical student.  BTW, this is the sixth course that I have completed through Coursera, including a specialization.  Good luck!",2

I took this just because I wanted to learn more about how the body magically does what it does, every day, without me thinking about it. I had no prior experience in physiology or anatomy, so this required me to do a LOT of note-taking and a little bit of Googling on the side for further understanding. If a week's videos totaled 2 hours, I spent about 4-5 getting through them and taking notes. I should add that I did not use the forums regularly, but I saw that many students had, and that their questions were answered fairly promptly, often by Emma Jakoi herself. The end-of-unit quizzes always included questions which forced you to apply your new learning to cases, and these could be challenging! Thanks to Duke for making this great class available online for free.",5

Introductory Human Physiology,By Joshua S,"Dec 9, 2019"," It is so hard to learn from a professor who can't get through 2  sentences without stumbling over her thoughts, mumbling, trailing off  and not finishing her sentence, etc. Perhaps if she spent less time  pretending to be John Madden with her little board, she could focus on  being an effective orator. Perhaps the second professor would have been better, but after 2 hours of listening to Dr. Jakoi, I now have to contact Coursera to see if I can get a refund or switch courses.",1

Introductory Human Physiology,By Dustin J,"Aug 23, 2020","I'm a college freshman (majoring in nursing) and I took this course due to the pandemic. I found this course challenging since it focuses more on the physiology of the human body in more detail than a regular my anatomy and physiology class back in high school. This course isn't really an ""introductory"" course, you may need some background on science courses like chemistry, biology, anatomy, and physiology (So keep that in mind if you want to enroll). I have a limited background in science these courses (Biology, chemistry, etc) and finished this course, and yes it is possible to finish this course without knowing all about science stuff, it just took a little more effort to quickly learn science terms and stuff. With all of that, the course was great and for a nursing major like me really helped me developed surface-level knowledge about the function of the human body. Lectures are good, a little fast for me but they provide great PDF that I can refer to. Practice quizzes did help me a lot, but I hope that they provide feedback or explanation on why I got it wrong instead of just showing ""correct"" or ""incorrect"". It's worth my time learning physiology and I highly recommend it! Big thanks to the instructors and staff, especially Coursera for making this course free to the public!",5

Mimi Jakoi and  Jennifer Carbrey are magnificent in their field, and they both provide their tremendous insight to a high-functioning foundation level for the subject. However, if you are someone like me, a middle school science teacher who was only looking to find a novice level of physiology, you are going to get above and beyond what you imagined. I would definitely recommend this course to those who are highly invested in the subject, as it provides a great breadth of detail to 10 human systems. ",5
Introductory Human Physiology,By Parvathy s n,"May 28, 2022",it was a fun ride to be a part of this journey of learning  HUMAN PHYSIOLOGY .....it was very much helpful for understanding the basic concepts of our body how our body functions internally as well their hormonal capabilities. i feel really confident now because the lecture was easy to understand i thoroughly enjoyed. thank you. ,5

Introductory Human Physiology,By Calista L,"Oct 8, 2020","Great things first: It’s a great course, with quite an
amount of information each video each module. For each week’s two to three
video hours, I spent 5 to 6 hours researching through googling or textbook
reading, and an intense note-taking all along. I highly recommend anyone who
wants a ‘warm-up’ in college physiology to do this course. This is perhaps a
first college level physiology, but it’s no way ‘introductory’. For a student with
mostly humanities background like me, it’s going to be a challenging course.
But it is really worth doing.",5

First Step Korean,By Mailine Y,"Oct 25, 2019","This class was very hard to follow. Pronunciation is key to any language. This course does not help you become even close to basic proficiency because there is no pronunciation key available. The worksheets are so hard to follow because it's all in Hangul with no pronunciation key or english pronunciation available. For a beginner course, this should have been standard- we don't know how to read Hangul and it shouldn't be expected during a beginners course. This course has a lot of room for improvement and would be great once they are implemented to become more user friendly. Also, rather than just using Hangul and English words in the videos, there should be pronunciation underneath the Hangul to make sure students are really getting the words correct instead of them trying to figure out word it is and referring to worksheets all the time. I did not have a good time learning the language because it was so frustrating trying to figure out what she was saying exactly- thus making the quizzes even more difficult!!",2

I do think that you have to come into this course with an understanding of the Korean alphabet and basic knowledge of how to compose and read letters. Once you have that down, this course definitely helps you begin to move forward in becoming fluent with verbal and written comprehension. You definitely have to practice and repeat your practice consistently to retain your new knowledge. I love this course. Thank you!",5

First Step Korean,By Kathy C,"Feb 15, 2017","This was a good course, but much more ambitious than the description or name suggests.  I had to watch the videos at 75% speed in order to figure out what was actually said, as I have never heard any Korean before.  I used the quizlet flashcards and some youtube videos in order to learn the material, as the ""lecture notes"" were not always very helpful.  So in all, a good course if you can access some supplementary activities.  In fact, adding the quizlet flashcards to the lesson either before the lecture or before the quiz would be helpful for future students.  I plan to take the class again in order to master the material.",3

Financial Markets,By Deleted A,"Apr 23, 2019","This course is virtually worthless. I couldn't follow the lectures, and I have a PhD and have been a tenured professor for almost two decades. The online course is based on snippets taken from face-to-face lectures and breakout sessions, and the result is utter incoherence. The instructor frequently refers to concepts that have not yet been encountered in the online version of the course; makes extensive use of mathematical notations and formulas whose variables are never properly explained; and generally does a poor job of explaining the material. This online version of the Yale course was obviously slapped together with very little thought and production value; it's one of those unsuccessful attempts to bring in revenue on the cheap, creating an online version out of existing face-to-face material, rather than building a real online course from scratch. This was wasted money and time. This attempt to capitalize on the Yale brand is pathetic.    ",1

Financial Markets,By Tiyash B,"May 3, 2018","A great introductory level course which is recommended for anyone with a remote interest in finance irrespective of whether they have a background in finance or economics. The strongest point of this course is the simplicity with which it conveys the importance and relevance of finance in today's world. The instructor and his team have taken great care to introduce topics in a manner simple enough for anyone to understand. While the course content may not go very in-depth into how a particular stock market works, or how particular stocks move, it provides great insight into why the stock market is necessary and relevant in our current society and how human behavior and its expression through policy and law can result in both financial progress and also crisis.

Financial Markets,By Doan T L ,"May 26, 2019","It’s a good online course in Finance that I have never learned before. I have gained the basic knowledge of financial markets and their applications in reality. Absolutely right, finance is not just about making money that I thought before joining in this course, and as a popular opinion as well, it is more than that, it has much more meaningful. This course has brought to me the necessary skills to make more rational decisions in my life, in my future career, I think. It’s also helped me to realize how I should work in this sector to serve the right purposes, to make the people living around me to be better. And it’s true that educational finance is very important to everyone. Professor Robert Shiller is an amazing teacher, many thanks to Professor Robert Shiller and Yale’s Financial Markets Course team. I highly recommend taking this course! ",5
Financial Markets,By Stefano E,"Mar 17, 2019","Probably the best financial market course on coursera. Intense and very rich in content. Too much,  though.

I had to review most of the videos a second time.",3

Now I have foundational understanding of finance upon which I can build my knowledge and also my ability to make informed application.",5
Financial Markets,By Anthony S,"Jan 10, 2019","Some parts of the course were informative.  Some were disappointing.  Replaying it in my mind now that I'm done, I feel that the course dwelt on the flaws of financial markets, rather than being an explanation of their workings.  It was an indictment of markets more than I would have expected, instead of being instructive toward them.  There was a section toward the end on ""critics of finance"".  Far less effort was made in defense of modern finance (a wonderful field).",3
Financial Markets,By Maumau B,"Jun 30, 2019","You can never get bored with Professor Shiller.

Business Analysis & Process Management,By Thomas G,"Dec 15, 2020","""Pause and look at this doc ok welcome back now pause and do it yourself ok you now know how to write a business plan"". The instructor simply read a script verbatim with no punctuation, pauses, or personality. The whole thing was incredibly rushed, and ""rushed"" is not the same thing as ""fast paced"".

"Python for Data Science, AI & Development",By Arjan Z,"May 23, 2019","the final assignment was extremely poorly set-up. Instructions were full of gaps, omissions, spelling mistakes.
